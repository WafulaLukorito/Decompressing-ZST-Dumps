It literally depends on what you want to do.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n&gt; a. The first question in my mind is: what is different between building a regular gaming computer, and the type of hardware needed for this? The last machine I built was probably 10 years ago and it was a gaming computer when I was younger. Things have changed so much since then, as far as hardware and software are concerned.\n\nThe difference is you're building for reliability, for expandability, for redundancy, for specificity. You could make a machine that was pure graphics cards, or pure backup (all harddrives), or pure compute (no storage, network boot, etc.). In other words, you customize it to specifically what you're looking for. Consumer pcs are generalist. They do everything ok. Gaming machines are actually a little specific, like a server, in that it's tilted towards gaming performance above all else (memory speed, ssd speed, graphics card speed, water-cooling to help increase speed, you see what I mean?)\n\n&gt; b. What type of hardware would I need that would allow me to run KVM with probably 64GB RAM to set aside for the VPSs themselves, as well as 100GB of Hard Drive space for each -- to run 10 - 12 instances of Linux. It would likely be more than enough to run the amount of VPS I use now.\n\nYou say KVM and then you say VPS. Are you trying to run your own VPS like hosting? In regards to your question, damn near every enterprise based server or workstation since 2010 should be able to support at least 64GB, and a couple of TBs of storage. Granted, some of the equipment you may have to update it's software to support bigger drives, but it should be like a 90% certainty that it should support your workflow.\n\n&gt; c. Is there a specific type of case, processor, motherboard, RAM, and fans that would allow me to hook up (hopefully) 12 SATA drives for a NAS?\n\nJust need a motherboard that has enough SATA ports and power to supply to them. If you're looking for specifics, go to [pcpartpicker](https:\/\/pcpartpicker.com\/) and try to build it yourself.\n\n&gt; d. Do I want an SSD for cache?\n\nDepends.

You can use almost any needle for this purpose just some may be easier than others. \n\n\nTo help you be more sure of your knowledge here's some copypasta - \n\n\n____\n\n____\n\n\n____\n\n\n#The Syringe \n\n\n\nI inject Estradiol Valerate using an insulin needle.\n\nMy needle is 25G x 5\/8\n\nMany people recommend different syringes but remember that your main objective is just to get the medication in your body. Almost any injection syringe *can* work but some will work better than others.\n\nSyringe terms may be confusing at first so let's just go over that real quick.\n\n___\n\n___\n\n\n\nFirst - those numbers - 25G x 5\/8\n\n**25G** stands for 25 Gauge needle. This is the *thickness* of the needle measured in [Birmingham gauge](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Birmingham_gauge). Where basically **the lower the value the more thick the needle**. Thicker needles can be helpful for thicker medications (which EV is kinda thick but meh), this is why some people recommend a thicker needle to draw the meds more easily, but then a thinner needle to inject with because a thinner needle will cause less discomfort. But you can do it all with one single use needle\/syringe.\n\n**5\/8** tells us the *Needle length* which in this case is 5\/8 of an inch long(or 16mm). \n\n\nYou have three main parts to a syringe\n\n*The Needle*  which is obviously the tip that penetrates.\n\n\n\n*The Barrel* which is the cylinder that holds the medication.\n\nAnd *The Plunger* which is the part you push down or draw back.\n\n\n___\n\n\n#Injecting \n\n\n\nNow let's talk about drawing your medicine and injecting\n\n[Here is one of many guides to self injections, this one is by Fenway Health](https:\/\/fenwayhealth.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/COM-1880-trans-health_injection-guide_small_v2.pdf) (.pdf)\n\n \n\nHere's how I draw the meds from the vial to get no air bubbles - \n\n\n___\n\n\n\nsome tiny air bubbles are apparently ok but big ones are a no-go.\n\nHOWEVER -  you can get almost no air bubbles by changing your method a bit. \n\nNormally people may draw a bit in, then push out bubbles, then repeat untill they have enough medicine in the vial. Lots of little air bubbles. Then people may just tap the syringe a bit to push the bubbles to the top before pushing them out by pressing the plunger a little.\n\n\nThere is another way.\n\n____\n\nSo normally you could - \n\n1. Draw enough air into syringe (little more than your dose) - this helps to keep pressure in the medicine vial around the same.\n\n2. Insert syringe in Vial of medicine and push air into vial.\n\n3. Flip vial over - make sure needle point is below the fluid line so it doesn't suck in any air.\n\n\n4. **Now here's the difference** - Draw the plunger of the syringe back well past the dose amount (to exactly double the dose amount) now HOLD IT there. You will feel the plunger trying to suck itself back in from the pressure difference. HOLD THE PLUNGER. Slowly but surely the medicine will fill the vial and be absent of most air bubbles.\n\n5. Once the liquid line in the syringe reaches around your dose amount you then expel the excess air and you're good to go as normal. Should be like no air bubbles at all. \n\n\n___\n\n\nBy doing the line at exactly double the dose and holding it you will know that when the medicine in the syringe reaches the dose line going *up* it will be equal to the dose amount as well. then go a little more for the gap by the needle.\n\nTechnically it doesn't really stop air bubbles but makes them all one big bubble form the start, which is easy to then push out as one.\n\n___\n\n\n I rotate my injections in the following locations in order:  Left [Ventrogluteal](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2YaB9crnPdU) (side butt), Right Ventrogluteal, [Left Thigh](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lqPTvQfh30Y), Right Thigh, [Left shoulder](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Dzdf2YfOuQw), Right shoulder\n\n (dorsoglute\/back-butt has risk of hitting nerve and ventroglute\/side-butt has a risk of hitting Hip bursae apparently, so just be aware of that and should be fine)\n\n\nFor any questions about names of bones\/landmarks they are using terms for, just double check google for it so you can feel around and learn new stuff too!\n\n___\n\n\n\n*Bonus*\n\n\n#Rubber Stopper Safety\n\n\nAnd now a public safety message - [Do you know about coring](https:\/\/www.registerednursern.com\/vial-coring-prevention\/) - be aware of injections safety!\n\n\n\n\nRemember to puncture the stopper in a  different place to avoid increasing wear. \n\n\n[Here is a pdf from Spine Intervention society](https:\/\/cdn.ymaws.com\/www.spineintervention.org\/resource\/resmgr\/factfinder\/FactFinder_2019_04_Vial_Cori.pdf) saying similar\n\n&gt;The prior puncture site should be avoided if a rubber stopper is penetrated more than once in the case of a multi-\ndose vial. \n\n\n___\n \n\n [Self-sealing capacity of vial stoppers after multiple needle punctures](https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/23636157\/)\n\n\n\n___\n\n\nlet me know if u want the crash course for calculating doses of medication","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1670002788,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"iyn9pbp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zaj301","locked":false,"name":"t1_iyn9pbp","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_zaj301","permalink":"\/r\/TransDIY\/comments\/zaj301\/would_these_needles_be_good\/iyn9pbp\/","retrieved_on":1673156713,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TransDIY","subreddit_id":"t5_31hgt","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/TransDIY","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

And this goes against what other people are saying but honestly I do think he should be responsible for your friends not showing up, he was throwing the party, he knew how important it was, he should have been texting reminders, and then also playing music and pumping up the people who are there and making it feel special regardless of who came. I think you should really think about this relationship, a lot of times birthdays highlight someone who’s just been skating by being a generally good S.O but doesn’t really care to go beyond that. Good luck!!!\n\nEdit to add: if you want a good birthday you have to very clearly ask for that or plan it for yourself, you’ll pretty much always be disappointed if not","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1670003240,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"iynaugn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zacvrr","locked":false,"name":"t1_iynaugn","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_zacvrr","permalink":"\/r\/relationship_advice\/comments\/zacvrr\/my_30f_boyfriend_32m_really_fumbled_my_30th\/iynaugn\/","retrieved_on":1673156681,"score":0,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"relationship_advice","subreddit_id":"t5_2r0cn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/relationship_advice","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

My laptop broke, but I have an IPad that I use to take notes during lectures and study. At the beginning of the school year I decided to purchase a bluetooth keyboard because I found very unpractical to type notes on the screen, also because I need to type very fast to write down the important things the professors say. I didn’t not have much money to spend on that, so when I found a second hand Logitech keyboard on amazon I purchased it, and I’m very happy with it because it was basically new but incredibly affordable. \nNow I guess someone can find it quite loud, louder than a flat keyboard or a laptop keyboard, not as loud as a mechanical keyboard, but as I said, I also type very fast. Some classmates told me they found it a bit annoying, but that they eventually got used to it. A couple of times people told me they had to change seat because they found the clicking sound too annoying and they could not stand it, but others, when I asked if I was bothering them, told me they didn’t mind. Today I noticed that a girl sitting next to me was not able to concentrate during the lecture, and I think it was because of my keyboard since se moved seat later.\nI’m really sorry my keyboard is causing so much trouble, but I also really need it. \nShould I just stop using it?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I mean do you have something that is specifically reactive to UV light you're trying to light? Also those wide beam are nice and all but you can get just as much of not more light from denser LED per meter strips. Those cablemod are only 30 per meter and they're pretty expensive, so in my book there's better options. I've used [these](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/BTF-LIGHTING-Flexible-Individually-Addressable-Non-waterproof\/dp\/B01CDTEJR0\/ref=sr_1_4?crid=TFMYNFZDWOLJ&amp;keywords=btf%2BARGB%2Bled%2Bstrips&amp;qid=1670002976&amp;sprefix=btf%2Bargb%2Bled%2Bstrip%2Caps%2C471&amp;sr=8-4&amp;th=1) in the [4 60 LED each towers](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/7TextJP) I made. 60 because that's all ICUE could address per lighting channel when I made them.

Practice with others. Don't try to sell yourself, just show who you are and be genuine (while also being professional). Also consider personal experiences\/stories that can apply to multiple prompts so you have substance to refer to (rather than \"I am a good leader and communicator\" you can say \"I enjoy communicating with others because It's important to me that I can strive to better understand what others are thinking and experiencing through open and honest discussions.

But if XYZ was the case, then I'd do this other thing\/consider this point of view\"). Have a stance, but try to better understand other options, cultural factors\/influences, beliefs, opinions, points of view. I also found it helpful to bring in personal experiences here, too.

If I were to encounter this again, I would like to have done this other thing better or considered this point of view more.\" -- when I did this, the interviewers definitely engaged more by asking with that experience as the framework for the larger prompt.

I ended up going 6 months in full remission which was great. I've recently had a backslide and have had PMDD the last 2 months, though not terribly bad where I could not function at all. I ended up using the low dose Prozac I had on hand but had never used, \"just in case\" , and it really did help. I used it the last 10 days of my cycle and stopped when I started spotting.\n\nBut here's my protocol, it's lengthy with lots of studies!! \nI've definitely deviated from my adherence to the sprouting of broccoli sprouts, and my prioritizing vit C, so that very well may have something to do with my relapse! I didn't type anything up about sulphoraphane\/broccoli sprouts, but there's research in sulphoraphane (active compound in broccoli sprouts) that show its good for all kinds of detoxification pathways which in turn is good for pmdd.\n***\n\n\n\nPmdd protocol\n\nI've now been 4 months pmdd free after 3 back to back HORRIBLE months of it in Nov-Dec-Jan of.\nI've been fine tuning my general protocol for years now. But there's a couple new things (Zinc and calcium rich green tea\/matcha lattes) that have helped the most! \nNow 6 months obviously doesn't mean I'm cured. But I do feel so much better that I feel I should share what I'm doing! \n***\n\nA friend suggested I try Zinc for my on and off insomnia and showed me this study. \n(https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5713303\/) \nI've since found MANY studies connecting zinc to mood\n(https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s12011-020-02316-3) \n(https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0165032711003533?via%3Dihub) \n\nSo I tried 15mg Zinc Picolinate just before bed with 2 Calm brand magnesium gummies and an Elderberry cbd gummie (the Quercitin in Elderberry helps absorb the zinc.. I've since noticed they sell zinc-elderberry supplements on Amazon as well! ) and I fell asleep in mere moments and have continued to every night I've taken this combo! 🎉🎉🎉💥 No more sleep issues!! \n\nFrom that point I realized my sleep has been off for over 5 years due to becoming a mom and perhaps much longer because before then I was drinking too much alcohol, which we know is horrible for true restful sleep. \n\nSo I began to look at all my mood issues as a possible end result of not getting enough deep, restorative sleep and decided that continuing to fix my sleep was my main objective and only good things would come for not only PMDD but overall health. \n\nFrom there I learned about Seasonal Affective Disorder and what it actually is:\nEssentially, when you wake up and see light🌤️, this sends cues to your brain to shut off melatonin production and that it's time to be alert and awake. It also starts a countdown of sorts, that tells the rest of your body that in 12-16 hours, it will be time to begin feeling sleepy again.  \n However, when the light is not strong, melatonin levels may stay higher than normal😴 which means that not only do you not feel very awake and alert, but this disturbs the countdown in your body for when sleepy time should be. This causes 'delayed sleep phase' or insomnia: SAD is essentially a disorder of circadian rhythm. \n\nSo I purchased these glasses, which I may not need for very much longer this year, as the sun is finally coming out again. I wear them for 20 minutes every morning while I'm sipping my tea. This is the kind of thing you need to do every day for at least a couple weeks to see benefits but I definitely think they help! 🍵🤓\n(Luminette 3 - World's first Light... https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B07VMRRB9Y?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) \n\nI also decided to give up coffee!!?\nWhich is insane. I would have hold you that you were absolutely MAD if you would have suggested this was possible a month ago. But in my reading, i know blood sugar highs and lows are no good for pmdd. I also know that coffee can jack you up and then you feel incredibly irritable when it wears off. \nAnd I felt so much better after 2 or weeks of better sleep after starting the zinc, that I felt resilient enough to give it a try. 💡 \nSo i'll either drink plain green tea with stevia or I drink a half soymilk(isoflavones can ease symptoms of rising and falling hormones) +half grassfed milk(omega 3s and calcium are good for pmdd!!) Matcha latte every morning. About 20 ounces. \nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC7716601\/\nhttps:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jcem\/article\/92\/8\/2952\/2597535?login=false\n\n\nMatcha and green tea are high in calming L-theanine and full of so many amazing antioxidants, which can only benefit PMDD and health in general! I love my lattes and I don't miss my coffee!! 🤯 They are also aromatase inhibitors, which means they block your testosterone from being converted into Estrogen, which seems like it could theoretically be helpful for the moods that accompany hormonal plunging and spiking. \nGreen tea is also Mast cell stabilizing. (many with pmdd find they benefit from Antihistamines.

I'm a newish owner in Alberta. Things I've learned:\n\n- Make sure to set the charger as a destination in the navigation so that battery preconditioning kicks on (this assumes you have battery preconditioning already - if not you'll have to wait for the update) Be warned that if you use Android Auto or CarPlay and set any type of navigation in another app, it will cancel the charger destination in the Hyundai navigation and preconditioning will turn off.\n- If you hold the Drive Mode button, it engages Snow Mode. This mode engages AWD when needed, disables the heavier regen breaks and smooths out your accelerating to avoid skidding.\n- The charge port door can be opened manually if the doors are unlocked. You have to push quite hard on the little bumps that are on the door.\n- If you want extra stats, you can buy an OBD dongle such as the [OBDLink CX](https:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/OBDLink-Bimmercode-Bluetooth-Adapter-Diagnostic\/dp\/B08NFLL3NT\/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3NM2X7EVTV13P&amp;keywords=obdlink+cx&amp;qid=1670004149&amp;qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjQ0IiwicXNhIjoiMS45OCIsInFzcCI6IjIuMjMifQ%3D%3D&amp;sprefix=obdlink+c%2Caps%2C182&amp;sr=8-5) that sends extra stats to your smart phone. (State of Charge, current drawn while charging, etc) You can integrate this dongle with the ABRP app to feed live data to the app. \n- Keep the rear defrost on if it's cold out. This helps a little bit with the lack of rear wiper.\n- If you find the displays too bright, there is a dark mode in the Setup -&gt; Themes menu.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1670004315,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"iyndjx0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_zap2y5","locked":false,"name":"t1_iyndjx0","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_zap2y5","permalink":"\/r\/Ioniq5\/comments\/zap2y5\/tips_for_new_ioniq_5_owner_in_bc\/iyndjx0\/","retrieved_on":1673156606,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Ioniq5","subreddit_id":"t5_3mzcjo","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Ioniq5","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Well, I suppose this is true if the fund manager has any conscience - otherwise you just shove the money in some low-risk crap and you just shrug your shoulders and say \"that's the markets\" if the returns are mediocre. I'm not sure how you tell the difference between the two approaches.\n\nWhat you probably want is for your portfolio to be mostly equities, if not entirely. The received wisdom is that you should hold some allocation to bonds, depending on your age and risk profile - you might want 20% or 30%, but in my opinion this wisdom no longer holds true, as bond yields are now historically anomalous; they are now (over the last decade) lower than they have been in literally [750 years or more.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/tqwqCTR.png)^[[PDF](https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/-\/media\/boe\/files\/working-paper\/2017\/eight-centuries-of-the-risk-free-rate-bond-market-reversals-from-the-venetians-to-the-var-shock.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=AB134099346A82E88844F8133AF10BE632BB010A)]\n\nYour provider will probably offer one fund which is entirely or almost entirely equities (sometimes it's the sharia fund), and that should probably be your primary pension vehicle (assuming you have a decade or two left in the workforce). Hopefully they also offer a fund which is just bonds which you can additionally use if you want bonds. Otherwise you would invest in bonds in your ISA or SIPP, if you really want them.\n\nIf you're analysing funds in this way then this one is not really for you.

I wasn't expecting to upgrade for a while but both of these came up and I had to make the jump.\n\nAnd ya, its very easy to clean out the hot water, it was one of the first things I did. The previous owner just assumed the water flow was supposed to be non existent because their newer Silvia Pro X suffered from the same issue. And after looking around the web a fair bit a lot of people experienced similar issues even with fairly soft water. I don't drink Americanos so it's not an issue for me but it's just a good thing to know especially because it's really easy to do.\n\nAnd I switched to this one from [amazon](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B08P4PMS3L?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) but I am considering on looking for another one because the screw doesn't sit very flush, I never notice a lot of build up in the gap but when I clean it once a week I do brush out a bit of coffee but I check my screen every day and don't notice much if any coffee. But I think a puck screen would solve this too, I have stayed away from puck screens because I know it will mess with my work flow, and I don't think the difference will be significant enough. I only switched out the shower screen because the one that came with it was very dirty and left behind an after taste even after I cleaned it out a lot, there were a bunch of coffee grinds inside the screen too that I was unable to get out without damaging the screen. I was considering on going with a regular OEM one but thought id give it a shot if I am already changing it out.\n\nI am using a rancilio 40-100-108 basket and its served me well but I will probably give an IMS basket a try in the near future. It took me a few shots to start pulling good tasting coffee, I did waste nearly a bag of coffee figuring things out, but I switched to my single dose basket which allowed me to pull a lot more shots without wasting as much. Most of my pucks have been coming out pretty solid, but it is very bean dependant one bag of beans I used would come out muddy every time, they are not my favorite beans so I won't miss using them. The coffee I use now produces a nice clean portafilter after each shot and the coffee tastes great.\n\nAnd I had the same feeling about the steam wand, controlling the pressure is tough either its not enough pressure to stir things up but its still heating my milk quickly, or I dial up the steam and it stirs it up super fast and I don't have the ability to make quality milk. But to be fair I don't care for latte art so as long as my milk tastes creamy I am ok with what I make now. So a two hole wand tip will likely come down the road. I plan on having an actual barista come over and teach me how to steam milk nicely so when I do want to show off I will know how lol.\n\nThe drip tray is a bit of an overblown issue, I was expecting it to be very annoying but its not a big deal at all. I empty it 2-3 times a week and its usually never that full, I just empty it out just so I don't have sitting water for to long. I would empty out just about any drip tray as often, it would be nicer if that lip was a bit shorter but its not a big deal at all.\n\nI love my machine, I usually turn it on before I take my dog for their walk, go around the block a few times and by the time im home the machine is 100% warmed up and ready to go. Even when I want a quick drink its usually up and running within 5min or less. I am very happy with it and was very happy with how fast I was able to figure it all out and learn to pull some very great shots and make some super tasty coffee. I was always happy with my Breville Barista pro but this is a great step up especially because I was able to sell it for nearly $600 (I bought it for $350), so essentially my current set up of a Silvia Pro and a Eureka XL cost me about $950 which is as good of a set up as you can get for under $1,000. I don't see myself upgrading to anything else in the near future, the only addition to my set up might be a second single dose grinder just so I can make some other drinks when people come over. But for now I am more then happy with what I have.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1670004415,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"iyndt1p","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ytobw6","locked":false,"name":"t1_iyndt1p","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_iyk09g6","permalink":"\/r\/espresso\/comments\/ytobw6\/rancilio_silvia_pro_x_finally_pulled_the_trigger\/iyndt1p\/","retrieved_on":1673156599,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"espresso","subreddit_id":"t5_2rqoi","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/espresso","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I like the idea of making my own playlist and buring them on physical medias that I can flip through to chose what I want to listen to. I also discovered Lightscribe recently, I really like the idea even though it's honestly useless, you, know, it's neat, so I think I'll try it in the future.\n\nSo I bought this KLIM Nomad from amazon because I didn't wanted to buy a used discman that would have used external batteries and cost almost as much as brand new models as far as I can see on ebay ... And chose this model in particular because it's the only one I found that had 4.5 star rating with a lot of reviews and because it has a window to see the disc spinning, which is quite cool imo. I did see in the reviews that lots of people said the bluetooth quality was bad tho, and also the price is a bit ridiculous to be honest when all things considered at 70€ ...\n\nThey come with Klim's best selling IEM according to them, the Klim Fusion. Unfortunately I won't be able to review their sound, the ones I receive are defective it seems, I think they misslabeled some box with drivers in it and a subwoofer was mounted instead of the actual drivers :\/ For real though they are simply trash, a bass canon, I'd be ashamed to push this kind of ewaste on people ... It's a shame by the way that their tuning is so horrible because if the bass would be reasonable then otherwise they would be ok, but as-is it's a joke. Cable has microphonics too. Really bad, I'd wish they would sell the player without them for 10 bucks less. To compare wit the moondrop CHU -&gt; it basically feels like I unstuck my head an elephant's ass when I remove the Fusion IEMs and put on the CHUs, night and day, one was tuned by an old vet who was in artillery and can't ear shit under 1Khz, the other is awesome.\n\nNow, the player itself, is pretty overall pretty good, although the bluetooth is indeed botched, with small beeping noises, mostly in the right side channel. You don't really notice them much if at all until there's passage with little to no sound in the song, like, I didn't hear anything for a couple of tracks until \"runwaway\" started, and with the intro that just has the piano touch it's obvious and ruins the experience. It sound like the noise of the laser reading the disc or the disc spinning. I didn't buy for the bluetooth tho so I personally don't really mind it, but it's definitely unreasonable to sell a product with such flaw, no doubt it deserves legal repercution in a sane world imo.\n\nFortunately the sound from the jacks is fine. I can't tell you much except that it doesn't seem subpar by any means, can't really tell much diference with my other DACs\/DAPs. I'd say they are slightly on the warmer side. You can use both jacks at the same time if you want by the way.\n\nIt doesn't really have the power to drive the ATH-R70X unsurprisingly, the max volume setting is just normal. It's barely enough to drive the AKG Q701. It pairs much better with the ATH-500X, Porta Pros, K142hd and IEMs.\n\nThe FM radio mode only register 4 stations with proper sound, it ignores the rest because they are not listennable(you can still manually go through all FM frequencies by steps of 100Khz to check for yourself). I don't know if maybe I would get more stations if I was outside? Maybe also the headphones used influence the quality of the reception, as they are used as antena to receive the signal?\n\nAll other functions work fine, the different playing mode, the touch lock, the no skip of course(didn't get a single skip so far), the EQ presets don't interest me much except the simple bass boost one, which is reasonable in how much it adds bass, it's not a lot but definitely noticeable, serves its purpose on the headphones I like to add bass to sometimes.\n\nI didn't test the battery life extensibly yet, but it's seems to be around the 14 hours anounced, just as most amazon reviews confirm that they get just a bit less, around 12 hours, but of course that depend of how it's used, with bluetooth or not, how much volume, how often the buttons are pressed making the screen backlight turn on, how often tracks are skipped which require the player to read the disc again(it stops reading when around 100 seconds before a track, because it already has those 100 seconds left in memory as part of the anti skip feature).\n\nAbout the anti skip feature by the way, I heard it might uses compression which then  kind of nulifies the high bitrate of the CD format, well I don't know if this one does that, I think it's more probable that it does than it doesn't but am not sure, but anyway I cannot tell, so shouldn't be a big deal I guess. I mean correct me if am wrong please but if I remember correctly the CD format has 1400kbps or so of bitrate, so that means the player would need 280mb of memory to store the 100 seconds uncompressed right? Sure it's not a lot in absolute, but for this kind of device I think it is to be expected to have the manufacturers try to cut corners and increase their margin by just putting 50mb of memory and using compression ...\n\nTo conclude, am happy with it, although I can hardly recommend this specific model, as the IEMs it comes with are objectively garbage, and they botched the bluetooth which is not ok. But hey, if you don't plan to use bluetooth and don't mind the price, then I guess those are a good pick.

You can skip the demographic part). Answer how you've felt in the last **TWO weeks** (not one). If you've scored over 10, you should take it more seriously.\n\n[Here's a list of symptoms associated with depression](https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/depression\/guide\/detecting-depression#1), so you can double check.\n\n**If you have healthcare insurance**, then go see your doctor and ask for a referral. I'd recommend either a [psychotherapy or CBT](https:\/\/www.harleytherapy.co.uk\/counselling\/psychodynamic-psychotherapy-vs-cbt.htm) psychologist first (for therapy). If that doesn't work after a few months, don't have anything to talk about, or already tried a therapist, then find a psychiatrist (for medication).\n\n**If you don't have healthcare insurance or want more help**, then here's a list of things that will help. Apply as many of them as you can.\n\nOften there is a hidden cause for your depression, you might not like yourself or your life. The below advice addresses the symptoms and will reduce them, but you still need to fix the cause.\nSome people don't know why they are depressed. A common reason is a lack of purpose. To live is to suffer, but it is possible to make that suffering bearable, if you do so while trying to achieve what you want more than anything else. **Let me know if you need help to find your purpose in life.**\n\nFor the below advice, take your phone and set repeating alarm clock reminders, with labels of what to do. Train yourself to either snooze or reschedule the reminders if you can't take action right away, but never to ignore them. The intention is [to condition yourself](https:\/\/www.cleverism.com\/classical-conditioning), to build habits, so you will start healing yourself without having to think about it.\n\n* **Sleep**: [There is a complex relationship](https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/depression\/guide\/depression-sleep-disorder#1) between [sleep and depression](https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/healthy-sleep\/depression-and-sleep). \nWhen you have days where you don't have to do anything, set an alarm clock. You really don't need more than 7 hours at most per night (a [little more](https:\/\/health.onehowto.com\/article\/how-many-hours-of-sleep-are-needed-per-night-by-age-8233.html) if you are under 18). If you can't fall sleep, try taking melatonin one hour before going to bed. It's [cheap](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B003JJ9TQA), OTC and [is scientifically proven](https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/vitamins\/ai\/ingredientmono-940\/melatonin) to help regulate your sleep pattern. [Also, rule](https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/sleep-disorders\/sleep-apnea\/news\/20120330\/sleep-apnea-linked-depression) out [sleep apnea](https:\/\/www.healthcentral.com\/article\/sleep-apnea-treatment-resistant-depression). Up to 6% of people have this, [but not everyone knows](https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/sleep-disorders\/sleep-apnea\/features\/sleep-apnea-clues). If you find yourself awake at night, start counting. Don't grab your phone, don't do anything interesting. We're trying to *bore* you to sleep, not keep you entertained - sometimes it might *feel* like you've done it for hours and hours, but often it's really not long. Anytime your mind wanders away from the numbers, start over at 1. count at the speed of either your heartbeat or your breathing. Then both Alexa and Google Home can also play a range of sleep sounds if you ask them (rain or other white noise) and there are also free apps for both Android and Apple devices.\n\n* **Go outside**: If you haven't been outside much lately, [you might just need some sunlight](https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/depression\/benefits-sunlight). \n15 minutes two to three times a week is enough. This will fix serotonin levels as well as vitamin D deficiencies.\n\n* **Meditate**: [Depressions can be significantly reduced by meditating](https:\/\/news.harvard.edu\/gazette\/story\/2018\/04\/harvard-researchers-study-how-mindfulness-may-change-the-brain-in-depressed-patients\/). The best types Of [Meditations For Depression Relief](https:\/\/www.thedailymeditation.com\/meditation-depression). \nYour attention is like a muscle. The more you train it, the better the control you have over it. [Mindfulness training](https:\/\/www.mindful.org\/meditation\/mindfulness-getting-started\/) will help you gain better control over your mind. It doesn't take much effort, just 15 to 20 minutes a day of doing nothing but focus your attention is enough and is scientifically proven to work. As you become better at focusing your attention, it will become easier to force yourself to stop having negative thoughts, which will break the negative reinforcement cycle. Go here for more: r\/Meditation\n\n* **Exercise**: [The effect of exercise on depressions](https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/depression\/in-depth\/depression-and-exercise\/art-20046495\/) \nIf you have access to a gym, then start lifting weights. If you don't have access to a gym (or you don't like lifting), start running. If you can't run, then start walking. Just start small. 10 minutes three times a week is fine. You don't have to run fast, just run and then slowly build it up over time. Exercising does several things: It releases endorphins, it takes your mind of your negative thoughts and it will improve your overall health.\n\n* **Give lots of hugs**: [Hugs release oxytocin](https:\/\/health.usnews.com\/health-news\/health-wellness\/articles\/2016-02-03\/the-health-benefits-of-hugging), which improves your mood and relaxes you. So find people to hug. If you are single, hug your parents or friends. If you can't, see if a dog is an option. Most dogs love to hug. Another solution that provides the same benefit is a [weighted blanket](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s?k=weighted+blanket) will provide a [similar positive effect at night](https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/anxiety\/do-weighted-blankets-work). [You should try to aim for 12 hugs a day](https:\/\/psychology-spot.com\/brain-needs) (if you currently don't hug a lot, I suggest you slowly build it up over time).\n\n* **Music**: [The right music can improve your mood](https:\/\/time.com\/5254381\/listening-to-music-health-benefits). The genre is not important as long as it is: *\"Upbeat, rhytmic and energetic\"*. What this means differs from person to person, depending on their music taste. I have a special playlist for this. One way to measure the effectiveness, of the songs is your ability to listen to it over and over (if you can listen to it hundreds of times it likely has the highest positive effect on your mood). The effect can be amplified by using headphones and playing it LOUD and can further be enhanced by closing your eyes (doi:10.1177\/0305735617734627, doi:10.1093\/jmt\/50.3.198 and doi:10.1177\/0305735617751050).\n* **You are not your depression**: For some people (often those that have been depressed for a long time), their depression has become a part of who they are and they assume a victim role. But that is a big problem, you have to *will* yourself into someone that sees themselves as a person that is actively fighting their disease, that *no longer identifies* with it, or else you will *unconsciously obstruct your own healing process*. As Eckhart Tolle expressed it in A New Earth:\n* &gt; *A very common role is the one of victim, and the form of attention it seeks is sympathy or pity or others' interest in my problems, \"me and my story.\" Seeing oneself as a victim is an element in many egoic patterns, such as complaining, being offended, outraged, and so on. Of course, once I am identified with a story in which I assigned myself the role of victim, I don't want it to end, and so, as every therapist knows, the ego does not want an end to its \"problems\" because they are part of its identity.*\n* **Jordan Peterson**: [How To Deal With Depression](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Xm_2zmX6Akc) (50 minutes). Jordan Peterson is a clinical psychologist, that's specialized in mythology. This is a compilation focusing specifically on depression.\n* **Practice gratitude**: Take 5 minutes every day [to practice gratitude.](https:\/\/www.pasadenavilla.com\/resources\/blog\/gratitude-and-depression)\n\n* **Volunteer**: Study after study shows that helping others without expecting anything in return [will lessen depression and has other health benefits](https:\/\/www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org\/hometown-health\/speaking-of-health\/3-health-benefits-of-volunteering). Let me know if you need some ideas.\n\n**Highest rated books**:\n\n* [Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Feeling-Good-New-Mood-Therapy\/dp\/0380731762)\n* [It's Not Supposed to Be This Way: Finding Unexpected Strength When Disappointments Leave You Shattered](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Its-Not-Supposed-This-Disappointments\/dp\/0718039858)\n\n[High quality free training provided by the Australian Health Service](https:\/\/www.cci.health.wa.gov.au\/Resources\/Looking-After-Yourself\/Depression)\n\n**Phone Apps**: Two popular free apps used to help fight depressions, are Wysa and [MoodTools](http:\/\/www.moodtools.org).

I would make anywhere from $0-40 an hour, depending on how busy it was, how generous people were feeling (I made more around the holidays), and sheer luck.\n\nVery quickly I realized that {making money street performing} and {the actual performance art you're doing} are two independent skill sets. The former is largely based on getting people to stop, and coming up with ways to interact with them and incorporate humor.\n\nQuickly I realized that little kids were my biggest customers. They were usually the ones who would run up and want to watch, and then their parents would end up watching as well. Kids often wanted to try the slinky themselves, so I bought a huge bulk order of 800 of [the slinky I was using at the time](https:\/\/amzn.to\/3FiGmtX) and started selling those also. I came up with a little routine where I would teach the kids a ridiculously easy \"trick\" with the slinky and then try to sell them to them (1 for $3 or 2 for $5). I also bought a blacklight (and battery pack) that would make the slinky glow a bit when it started getting darker out.\n\nI would make a bit more once I started doing this - reliably maybe $20-40 an hour on weekends when there were lots of people out.\n\nMy biggest day by far was near Christmas when there was a holiday parade that went through the mall area, so there were huge crowds later into the evening. I made about $500 gross in maybe 9 hours.\n\nIf you want to do this. there are a couple things you want to watch out for:\n\n1. You want to find a decent place to busk, ideally a pedestrian mall with shops and tourists. Not all cities have one, especially in the US. Most business won't allow you to set up right in front of them either, so you've got to find a spot where it's okay.\n2. You need to know the local ordinances about street performing. On the 16th St Mall, I was technically required to move my setup every hour, since I was using an amplifier. I was also technically not allowed to sell anything, though this wasn't really enforced in my case. Some cities have tons of restrictions on busking, either because there's tons of competition for it (like in Las Vegas), or they see it as \"panhandling\" and a nuisance (San Antonio, TX).\n\nOkay, that wasn't short at all. Hope that helps.

You won't be able to test out whether the situation is always as bad as you expect, so you miss the chance to work out how to manage your fears and reduce your anxiety. Anxiety problems tend to increase if you get into this pattern. Exposing yourself to your fears can be an effective way of overcoming this anxiety.\n\n*[The experience of anxiety involves nervous system arousal.](https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/insight-therapy\/201009\/overcoming-fear-the-only-way-out-is-through) If your nervous system is not aroused, you cannot experience anxiety. Understandably, but unfortunately, most people attempt to cope with feelings of anxiety by avoiding situations or objects that cause the feelings. Avoidance, however, prevents your nervous system from getting used to it. So avoidance guarantees that the feared object or situation will remain new, and hence arousing, and hence anxiety provoking. Even worse, avoidance will generalize over time. If you avoid the elevator at work, you will soon begin to avoid all elevators, and then all buildings that house elevators. Soon enough, you'll be living in a prison of avoidance.*\n\nIf your anxiety is situational and not too extreme, you can try to address it through exposure therapy. You slowly expose yourself to situations that you know gives you fear. Here are two easy to follow guides on that. The one regarding spiders, is a blue print, you can replace spider with anything, fear of driving, fear of using a phone, anything.\n\n* [How to Overcome the Fear of Spiders](https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Overcome-the-Fear-of-Spiders) (wikihow)\n* [How to Overcome Fear](https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Overcome-Fear) (wikihow)\n\nOverthinking:\n\n* [How to know\/what to do: Overthinking](https:\/\/www.verywellmind.com\/how-to-know-when-youre-overthinking-5077069)\n* [Intrusive Thoughts and Overthinking: The Skill of Cognitive Defusion](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=V3vhXQy48jo) (youtube, 1.2M views)\n\nFor the below advice, use technology to your advantage. Take your phone and set repeating alarms, with labels of what to do. Train yourself to either snooze or reschedule the reminders if you can't take action right away, but never to ignore them. The intention is [to condition yourself](https:\/\/www.cleverism.com\/classical-conditioning\/), to build habits, so you will start healing yourself without having to think about it.\n\n* **Sleep**: [Good sleep is very important when treating anxiety](https:\/\/www.anxiety.org\/sleep-a-fundamental-cure-for-anxiety)\nWhen you have days where you don't have to do anything, don't oversleep, set an alarm clock. You really don't need more than 7 hours at most per night (a [little more](https:\/\/health.onehowto.com\/article\/how-many-hours-of-sleep-are-needed-per-night-by-age-8233.html) if you are under 18). If you can't fall sleep, try taking melatonin one hour before going to bed. It's [cheap](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B003JJ9TQA\/), OTC and [is scientifically proven](https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/vitamins\/ai\/ingredientmono-940\/melatonin) to help regulate your sleep pattern. [Also, rule](https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/sleep-disorders\/sleep-apnea\/news\/20120330\/sleep-apnea-linked-depression#1) out [sleep apnea](https:\/\/www.healthcentral.com\/article\/sleep-apnea-treatment-resistant-depression). Up to 6% of people have this, [but not everyone knows](https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/sleep-disorders\/sleep-apnea\/features\/sleep-apnea-clues#1). If you find yourself often awake at night, start counting. Don't grab your phone, don't look at the clock, don't do anything interesting. We're trying to *bore* you to sleep, not keep you entertained - sometimes it might *feel* like you've done it for hours and hours, but often it's really not all that long. Anytime your mind wanders away from the numbers and starts thinking, start over at 1. count at the speed of either your heartbeat or your breathing, whatever you prefer. Then both Alexa and Google Home can also play a range of sleep sounds if you ask them (rain or other white noise) and there are also free apps for both Android and Apple devices.\n* **Meditate**: [Anxiety can be reduced with meditation](https:\/\/bebrainfit.com\/meditation-anxiety\/). [10 minute meditation for anxiety](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=O-6f5wQXSu8) (youtube). \nYour attention is like a muscle. The more you train it, the better the control you have over it. [Mindfulness training](https:\/\/www.mindful.org\/meditation\/mindfulness-getting-started\/) will help you gain better control over your mind. It doesn't take much effort, just 15 to 20 minutes a day of doing nothing but focus your attention is enough and is scientifically proven to work. As you become better at focusing your attention, it will become easier to force yourself to stop having negative thoughts, which will break the negative reinforcement cycle. Go here if you have specific questions: \/r\/Meditation\n* **Exercise**: [The effect of exercise on anxiety](https:\/\/www.calmclinic.com\/anxiety\/treatment\/exercising) \nIf you have access to a gym, then start lifting weights. If you don't have access to a gym (or you don't like lifting), start running. If you can't run, then start walking. Just start small. 10 minutes three times a week is fine. You don't have to run fast, just run and then slowly build it up over time. Exercising does several things: It releases endorphins, it takes your mind of your negative thoughts and it will improve your overall health.\n* **Give lots of hugs**: [Hugs release oxytocin](https:\/\/health.usnews.com\/health-news\/health-wellness\/articles\/2016-02-03\/the-health-benefits-of-hugging), which improves your mood and relaxes you. So find people to hug. If you are single, hug your parents or friends. If you can't, see if a dog is an option. Most dogs love to hug. Another solution that provides the same benefit is a [weighted blanket](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s?k=weighted+blanket) will provide a [similar positive effect at night](https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/anxiety\/do-weighted-blankets-work#benefits).

It had a plastic handle and the standard metal single blade.\n\nIt made literally perfect uniform slices from cheese, just the right thickness for putting on crackers or anything else.   We used it for years until about the time I turned 16, when the plastic handle splintered and came off.   That left it with the blade part intact and a two inch metal step to hold it by.  \n\nThat was more than 30 years ago and I still have it.  It still slices cheese perfectly.  I keep meaning to put a new handle on it, I'm just used to not getting much of a grip when I slice cheese.\n\nThe second thing is from a picnic basket we had in storage in our basement for years... I think the basket might have been a wedding gift to my parents.   I don't remember us ever using it.  It had some flatware and other basic stuff included in an elastic holder under the lid on one side.   This included a can opener, like this one:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Chef-Craft-Select-Butterfly-Opener\/dp\/B00LSD7KGU\n\n(No affiliation, I'm  just using the link to illustrate).\n\nOne day our \"regular\" can opener broke, which interfered with Mom making lunch.  I had \"explored\" boxes in the basement thoroughly at various points, and found the can opener, so I went down and got it as a backup, and lunch was had.\n\nI think I took it with me when I moved out, and despite having owned and broken two of the more modern can openers, it's still the one I use the most, it's probably over 70 years old.\n\n\nEdit:  I just looked for the first time at both of these for ID information.  The can opener is a \"miracle opener model 881 from EKCO.

They don't need to be anything special, no fast charging, something around 2A (10W, I think 11W are common) will be more than enough + wont heat up the charger at all.

The below advice addresses the symptoms and will reduce them, but you still need to fix the cause.\nThat's the whole point of therapy. With professional guidance, figuring out the causes and then addressing them one by one. If you want to skip that step, you'll have to compensate for it somehow. You should review your life and see if there are any obvious causes for your sadness and find ways to remove them or make them more bearable.\n\nSome people don't know why they are depressed. A common reason is a lack of purpose. To live is to suffer, but it is possible to make that suffering bearable, if you do so while trying to achieve what you want more than anything else. **Let me know if you need help to find your purpose in life.**\n\nFor the below advice, take your phone and set repeating alarm clock reminders, with labels of what to do. Train yourself to either snooze or reschedule the reminders if you can't take action right away, but never to ignore them. The intention is [to condition yourself](https:\/\/www.cleverism.com\/classical-conditioning), to build habits, so you will start healing yourself without having to think about it.\n\n* **Sleep**: [There is a complex relationship](https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/depression\/guide\/depression-sleep-disorder#1) between [sleep and depression](https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/healthy-sleep\/depression-and-sleep). \nWhen you have days where you don't have to do anything, set an alarm clock. You really don't need more than 7 hours at most per night (a [little more](https:\/\/health.onehowto.com\/article\/how-many-hours-of-sleep-are-needed-per-night-by-age-8233.html) if you are under 18). If you can't fall sleep, try taking melatonin one hour before going to bed. It's [cheap](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B003JJ9TQA), OTC and [is scientifically proven](https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/vitamins\/ai\/ingredientmono-940\/melatonin) to help regulate your sleep pattern. [Also, rule](https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/sleep-disorders\/sleep-apnea\/news\/20120330\/sleep-apnea-linked-depression) out [sleep apnea](https:\/\/www.healthcentral.com\/article\/sleep-apnea-treatment-resistant-depression). Up to 6% of people have this, [but not everyone knows](https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/sleep-disorders\/sleep-apnea\/features\/sleep-apnea-clues). If you find yourself awake at night, start counting. Don't grab your phone, don't do anything interesting. We're trying to *bore* you to sleep, not keep you entertained - sometimes it might *feel* like you've done it for hours and hours, but often it's really not long. Anytime your mind wanders away from the numbers, start over at 1. count at the speed of either your heartbeat or your breathing. Then both Alexa and Google Home can also play a range of sleep sounds if you ask them (rain or other white noise) and there are also free apps for both Android and Apple devices.\n\n* **Go outside**: If you haven't been outside much lately, [you might just need some sunlight](https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/depression\/benefits-sunlight). \n15 minutes two to three times a week is enough. This will fix serotonin levels as well as vitamin D deficiencies.\n\n* **Meditate**: [Depressions can be significantly reduced by meditating](https:\/\/news.harvard.edu\/gazette\/story\/2018\/04\/harvard-researchers-study-how-mindfulness-may-change-the-brain-in-depressed-patients\/). The best types Of [Meditations For Depression Relief](https:\/\/www.thedailymeditation.com\/meditation-depression). \nYour attention is like a muscle. The more you train it, the better the control you have over it. [Mindfulness training](https:\/\/www.mindful.org\/meditation\/mindfulness-getting-started\/) will help you gain better control over your mind. It doesn't take much effort, just 15 to 20 minutes a day of doing nothing but focus your attention is enough and is scientifically proven to work. As you become better at focusing your attention, it will become easier to force yourself to stop having negative thoughts, which will break the negative reinforcement cycle. Go here for more: r\/Meditation\n\n* **Exercise**: [The effect of exercise on depressions](https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/depression\/in-depth\/depression-and-exercise\/art-20046495\/) \nIf you have access to a gym, then start lifting weights. If you don't have access to a gym (or you don't like lifting), start running. If you can't run, then start walking. Just start small. 10 minutes three times a week is fine. You don't have to run fast, just run and then slowly build it up over time. Exercising does several things: It releases endorphins, it takes your mind of your negative thoughts and it will improve your overall health.\n\n* **Give lots of hugs**: [Hugs release oxytocin](https:\/\/health.usnews.com\/health-news\/health-wellness\/articles\/2016-02-03\/the-health-benefits-of-hugging), which improves your mood and relaxes you. So find people to hug. If you are single, hug your parents or friends. If you can't, see if a dog is an option. Most dogs love to hug. Another solution that provides the same benefit is a [weighted blanket](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s?k=weighted+blanket) will provide a [similar positive effect at night](https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/anxiety\/do-weighted-blankets-work). [You should try to aim for 12 hugs a day](https:\/\/psychology-spot.com\/brain-needs) (if you currently don't hug a lot, I suggest you slowly build it up over time).\n\n* **Music**: [The right music can improve your mood](https:\/\/time.com\/5254381\/listening-to-music-health-benefits). The genre is not important as long as it is: *\"Upbeat, rhytmic and energetic\"*. What this means differs from person to person, depending on their music taste. I have a special playlist for this. One way to measure the effectiveness, of the songs is your ability to listen to it over and over (if you can listen to it hundreds of times it likely has the highest positive effect on your mood). The effect can be amplified by using headphones and playing it LOUD and can further be enhanced by closing your eyes (doi:10.1177\/0305735617734627, doi:10.1093\/jmt\/50.3.198 and doi:10.1177\/0305735617751050).\n* **You are not your depression**: For some people (often those that have been depressed for a long time), their depression has become a part of who they are and they assume a victim role. But that is a big problem, you have to *will* yourself into someone that sees themselves as a person that is actively fighting their disease, that *no longer identifies* with it, or else you will *unconsciously obstruct your own healing process*. As Eckhart Tolle expressed it in A New Earth:\n* &gt; *A very common role is the one of victim, and the form of attention it seeks is sympathy or pity or others' interest in my problems, \"me and my story.\" Seeing oneself as a victim is an element in many egoic patterns, such as complaining, being offended, outraged, and so on. Of course, once I am identified with a story in which I assigned myself the role of victim, I don't want it to end, and so, as every therapist knows, the ego does not want an end to its \"problems\" because they are part of its identity.*\n* **Jordan Peterson**: [How To Deal With Depression](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Xm_2zmX6Akc) (50 minutes). Jordan Peterson is a clinical psychologist, that's specialized in mythology. This is a compilation focusing specifically on depression.\n* **Practice gratitude**: Take 5 minutes every day [to practice gratitude.](https:\/\/www.pasadenavilla.com\/resources\/blog\/gratitude-and-depression)\n\n* **Volunteer**: Study after study shows that helping others without expecting anything in return [will lessen depression and has other health benefits](https:\/\/www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org\/hometown-health\/speaking-of-health\/3-health-benefits-of-volunteering).

Typically I stick my fingers down a few inches to feel for moisture but I had a problem with fungus gnats previously and had to dress the top with sand. It stopped the gnat problem, but now I can't really tell moisture levels\n\nPotting soil: [miracle grow moisture control potting mix](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Miracle-Gro-Moisture-currently-Northeastern-Midwestern\/dp\/B00FE1GGG2\/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=moisture+control+potting+mix&amp;qid=1670005227&amp;sr=8-2)\n\nLights: [2 spider farmer SF1000s](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Spider-Farmer-Dimmable-MeanWell-Spectrum\/dp\/B07TS82HWB\/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=spider+farm+1000&amp;qid=1670005514&amp;sr=8-3&amp;ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.f5122f16-c3e8-4386-bf32-63e904010ad0)\n\nFor a burnt plant, should I raise the light, shornen the duration they're on, or both?\n\nFor fertilizing, I tired to follow the instructions on the back: 1 cup for every 20 sqft, so I just did a tablespoon in the 5g bag and mixed it. I only did this when I was transplanting and mixing the soil to go into the 5g bag about 4 weeks ago, and haven't touched it since. Should I be amending with bone meal reagularly? How will I know to amend and how often?\n\nRight now my tent is 50 sqft, so it's rather large. Perhaps it's not quite as large as it needs to be when these get bigger.\n\nre: trellising, my plan was to let these run along the ground, which I've done for watermelon in the past and haven't had issues with, but I've never successfully grown honeydew\/canteloupe because of pests. I assumed that was okay. Do I need to prop these up or is that just an option?\n\nRelative humidity in the tent is consistently 30 degrees.\n\nAs always, I appreciate your thoughtful reply and look forward to hearing what you have to say.

But also, look at what that graph is saying before you post it. of course climate change hasn't cost us much because we haven't done anything about it in any meaningful way. Your graph says nothing and you should be ashamed for posting it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnthropogenic climate change is a fact backed by decades of dedicated research and countless hours of hard working scientists from around the earth in one massive effort to understand just how much damage we've done to our planet. We absolutely can overcome climate change, not without consequence, but your dismissal of the issue is dangerous and a complete misrepresentation of the truth. If you think polluting less and creating a clean earth for your kids is bad, you're just an evil person - and no 'liberal educated scientists' are trying to fuck the world up just because they can. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMake no mistake, life will go on. Just not the one we know.

Normally, you don't need all the engine running all the medical gear.  \n\nI switched from an emergency vehicle battery to a much stronger one with just over 1000 amps.  When I tested my old 7 month battery, it showed it had a 12.5 volt charge, but Napa told me the battery was dead (no more amps left).  The vehicle started right up with the new battery.  Also, I disconnected all 3 of the batteries on the bottom side of the door.  They are needed if you aren't running medical stuff and the inverter.  If you keep them connected, they might drain your main battery under the hood.\n\nIf you don't start you ambulance every few weeks, it may ruin the battery.
