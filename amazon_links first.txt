I'd never really heard of him until recently, but he's quickly become one of my favorite writers. His prose is simple but beautiful, his stories rich and complex.\n\nAfter the Quake is a slim set of six haunting, evocative short stories set in 1990s Japan. It's really hard to describe this set of stories, as they are fairly varied, but they are often intimate, often dream-like. The situations are sometimes strange but the characters deeply human. There's an air of instability that pervades the stories - all occur in the aftermath of the 1995 earthquake, although none of the stories directly deal with the event. As I said, it's really hard to describe what the book is about, but let me just say this: when I finished it it gave me a legitimate twelve-hour high. It's really an excellent short story collection. If you want to know more, [here's the New York Times review of it](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/18/books/a-shock-to-the-system.html).\n\nNorwegian Wood is a novel about college students in 1960s Tokyo. I'm going to have to urge you to absolutely not read either of the editorial reviews on Amazon, as both contain plot details that don't occur until towards the end of the novel. The [New York Times review](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/24/books/rubber-souls.html) is fairly safe, but don't read the last paragraph. The story is really emotionally engaging, and Murakami's prose is just absolutely brilliant in this one. If you don't believe me, drop by a bookstore and read the first section. One of the greatest intros to any book I've ever read. The rest of the book is also incredible.\n\nI figure either one would provide some diversity to the list of largely Sci-Fi titles already proposed.","subreddit":"redditbookclub","score":3,"edited":true}

{"author":"princemyshkin","controversiality":0,"body":"&gt; I would argue that an \"orally dominant culture\" would accrue legend at a slower pace than today (cont...) \n\nThis is a natural thought, and from the rise of Biblical Criticism, this was one of the points that drove people to naturally assume legend had significantly morphed the Jesus story into something of a legend, far from historical fact. However, it is not fair to suggest their culture was the same as ours. Even though myth and legend can corrupt a story very very quickly today, really means nothing because these two cultures are so different. A few points need to be taken into account:\n\n* New studies on oral cultures (there are still a few in the world today) that would be very similar to 1st century Palestine demonstrate very little legend destroying the culture. In fact, it was the opposite, where the essential elements of the story were passed down from generation to generation almost flawlessly. To be fair, unnecessary elements of the story (little details, not significant to the overall message) changed from orator to orator . \n* In these cultures, the elders act as safeguards for the stories themselves, and their presence visibly prevents distortion in the story. Along these lines, the presence of eyewitnesses who were personally involved with the Jesus story would have still been around at the time that this \u201clegend\u201d was supposed to be accruing. In an orally dominant culture, this makes legend all the more unlikely.\n* The memory of individuals in orally dominant cultures is also fantastic. \n* Surprisingly, we do see legend accruing! Only it clearly comes into play from the mid 2nd century and on, most notably within the Gnostic sect, who took Jesus and morphed his story and his sayings to fit their worldview. But this legend is very easy to spot, and it comes about in a time frame where we would expect legend to begin to accrue, and it comes within different sects of people who were always looking for new gods to help their cause. \n\nThere are more points to be made, but I've just covered some of the essentials off the top of my head. If you'd like to read more, check out this [book](http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Legend-Historical-Reliability-Tradition/dp/0801031141) it has a great section on oral cultures and the new studies. \n\n&gt; Please give examples of the independent, external witness testimony\n\nSure:\n\n* Lets start with Josephus. His passage is the most famous, notably because if read at face value, it appears that this Jewish-turned-Roman historian explicitly affirms some theological tenets of Christianity \u2013 that Jesus is divine and rose from the dead! But a closer examination shows that the theological elements were clear additions by scribes at a later period. We conclude this because, first of all, the theological remarks are incredibly out of place in Josephus' writings. Second, the style of the Greek is remarkably different and fragmented as soon as the theological aspects begin. However, several elements in the passage are very much in Josephus' style. The quip about Jesus being a \u201cwise man\u201d and talking about the Christians as a \u201ctribe\u201d is not something you would expect from a later Christian addition. This makes it fairly certain that Josephus did include an original remark about Jesus, likely this: \u201cAbout this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, for he was one who wrought surprising feats. He won over many Jews and many of the Greeks. When those who had, in the first place come to love him did not give up their affection for him, and the tribe of the Christians, so called after him, has still to this day not disappeared.\u201d (Antiquities, 18.63-64)\n* The Talmud, a collection of Jewish Rabbinical writings and commentaries, contains a number of polemical passages against Jesus. In Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 107b (look it up) tells a story of Jesus, and how he \u201cpracticed magic and led the people astray.\u201d This is significant, 1) it shows that he did exist. Why would the Jews, who were accused of killing Jesus and who HATED the Christian movement, admit to the existence of their leader, if in fact he did not exist? 2) It also shows that Jesus performed \u201cmiracles,\u201d or at least wonders, for the same reason as the first point. It is surprising that the Jews do not deny miracles, but rather attribute them to magic. \n* The Talmud also contains stories of how Jesus was, rather than being born of the virgin Mary, was actually born from a Roman mercenary named Pandera, which is likely a play on words. The word for \u201cvirgin\u201d in greek is \u201cparthenos.\u201d At any rate, the Jews do speak of Jesus. \n* The Roman historian Tacitus, in a statement written in 115, explicitly talks about the Christian movement: \u201cChristus (Christ), from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome.....\u201d \n* Other Roman historians, Pliny the Younger and Suetonius, both make mention of the Christian movement, although there is nothing explicitly said concerning Jesus himself. \n* Furthermore, there are several Christian sources not in the canon that mention Jesus much more explicitly, although these would not carry the same weight since they come from within the Christian movement. \n\n&gt; Why are the writings of Jesus himself not in the NT? Did he not learn how to write (pretty silly if you think he was God incarnate)? \n\nWell Jesus was clearly a man, just like you and I, and he likely lead a group of followers, teaching to them in parables and sayings, and doing some \u201cmiraculous\u201d things. There is a question of whether Jesus was literate or not, although scholars tend to think that he probably was. Nevertheless, it is highly unlikely that he ever wrote anything down. His followers shared his sayings and his deeds, and passed them around (oral culture) and eventually wrote them down. Being God incarnate (as the Christians claim) also does not detract from Jesus' humanity. So it should come as no surprise that Jesus did not write anything down. \n","score":1,"subreddit":"atheism","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"retrieved_on":1425963296,"ups":1,"downs":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","id":"c099v9m","created_utc":"1241258397","score_hidden":false,"name":"t1_c099v9m","link_id":"t3_8h507","archived":true,"parent_id":"t1_c099kdn","gilded":0,"author_flair_text":null,"distinguished":null}

Pastors in particular know very little about the text and biblical Criticism in particular. It is a sad state of affairs. There are exceptions, but I feel the majority are just that way. Nevertheless, it is clear that the Pastors firmly believe their faith.

I do think the Church, by and large, is a positive force in the world. Pastors are there psychologically and spiritually for their congregation, providing support and encouragement in a sometimes maddeningly absurd world. They are there for pain and suffering, and also there for the joy and blessing. This type of support should not go overlooked, and it is something that those outside of the church are likely missing (and they don't even know it, or how significant it can be). \n\nAlso, to suggest that Pastors actually make a decent living is... well, flat out wrong. They make zilch. They do it out of love. If you wanted to become a Pastor, well get ready for ulcers and stress and long, tireless days, with little to no pay. It is only the mega-church pastors and the fake televangelists who actually make real money \u2013 and to hell with them! They deserve the literal lake of fire!! \n\nBut to be fair, there are also elements in the church that I cringe at. The whole \u201cintelligent design\u201d movement, the severe backlash against anything that might threaten their faith, the misconception that God is in control of your life and you need not worry (and the dangerous side-effect that you need not plan ahead or be responsible). The overly pious life, and the general \u201cbubble\u201d you live within. Those can be dangerous. But by and large, I think the good outweighs the bad. When I meet strong Christians, I do not open up about my agnosticism, I don't want to tear down their faith. I could easily do it, but I don't think it would be in their best interest. \n\n&gt; in the vast sea of medical cases, there are a couple where people just get better, as people usually don't do. This is statistical anomaly, well documented in all branches of science, nothing miraculous about it.\n\nYes, I am well aware of that, and that is one of the reasons why even some seemingly compelling miracle stories are likely just that - statistical anomalies. But the story I referred to earlier was different. It was a remarkable recovery from a number of different, some of them fatal, diseases and complications, that happened literally overnight. And was apparently accompanied by a vision from heaven.... it is all very bizzare.

(cont...)\n\nReally, its not that surprising. What do you expect? Jesus was a man just like you and I, he held no special powers, or at least if he did, there is a mysterious interplay between his humanity and his divinity. But honestly, he lived and taught amongst an illiterate culture. He may not have even known how to read, so how could he write? And the oral culture was perfectly suitable for passing down his sayings intact, carrying the gist of his message far enough until the early church eventually wrote them down. \n\n&gt; If Jesus was God, then his writings would have been the true WORD OF GOD. As I mentioned before, this means Christians could throw away potentially flawed writings by mortals such as Paul and stop giving so much credence to the OT. His WORD could have been the perfect and sole source for Christian teachings. I doubt he would have thought \"Well, I could clear up a whole lot of future arguments by writing my instructions down, but, eh.\" I doubt we would be having this discussion if Jesus had just written what he preached. Heck, maybe he would have thrown in some advanced knowledge like DNA coding, which would seem like gibberish at the time, but when we figured it out, it would confirm his divinity... I know, I know, then we wouldn't need faith. But why would God put us here, give us free will and reasoning, intentionally not give substantial evidence of his existence, and then punish us with eternal damnation if we determined there was not sufficient evidence to believe he existed? That's absurd to me: ~70 measly years of flawed mortal existence not believing in him warrants forever, infinity of hell.\n\nVery good points \u2013 I agree with you completely. This line of argument (and others) clearly suggests that the traditional Christian theology is flawed. But don't throw Jesus out with the bathwater. We can still view Jesus as some sort of divine messenger, without the systematic or Christian theology that screws everything up and causes these logical problems. The question of who Jesus really was is a puzzling one, and its what I currently focus all my study on today (and likely will for a long, long time). \n\n&gt; Oh yeah, explain the origin for the idea of hell and Satan, because the bible is very vague about both. I have heard Satan came about hundreds of years after Nicea as a means to scare people into good behavior and loyalty. It is certainly not explicit in the OT. The serpent in Genesis is only that, a talking snake. It never says, even in context, that the serpent IS Satan. God often talks about being better than the other Gods in town, actually acknowledging their existence, but that they are inferior (e.g. Moses and the staff snake trick against the Pharaoh's)\n\nThe Nicea theory is pure bunk, sorry :) \n\nHere's what probably happened: you're right, Satan theology and hell was not present throughout all of scripture. The serpent is just a serpent, Satan in Job actually just means \u201caccuser,\u201d etc etc. The first notion of an supremely evil entity actually first arises in the intertestamental books, which arose out of the period following the Jewish exile to Babylon and the continuing oppression under the Greeks and Romans. \n\nSo picture this, you're a Jew living in the promised land and all is good. It is easy to see God as the provider for all these things, and there is no need for a supreme evil being \u2013 after all, where is the evil? However, when the mighty Babylonian empire comes along and utterly destroys your temple, desecrates it, kills your livestock, women, children, and carries only the men off to Babylon, what are you to think then? Why did this happen?? Questions start to arise. \n\nMeanwhile, in Babylon, they practice Zorastrianism, whereby there are two Gods, both equal in power in might. One is supremely evil, the other is supremely good. Kinda like the ying and the yang. The Jews who are experiencing all this plight come into contact with this religion, and a syncretising affect begins. They start to blame their departure on this evil deity and turn to Yahweh for their salvation. There are several more affects of this worldview clash, Satan is just one. Heaven is another. But out of this period and following, we begin to see the Devil more prominent in scripture. The genre of literature that arose out to this period very fascinating, and you can literally see the development and evolution of their theology happening. \n\n&gt; There were many people at that time that claimed to be the Christ or a messiah.\n\nTrue, but in all the other cases, these Messiah's and their movement quickly evaporated after their leader's death. Only Jesus' movement survived, and actually thrived, blossoming into what we see today. \n\n&gt; While the studies on oral cultures today are compelling, they have had 2000 years to get better at it. And looking at the Native American tribes, their storytelling/religion is full of legend and myth. While they had some crude drawings, I would describe them as an oral culture, and it remained this way until as recent as around 200 years ago.\nIn my opinion, you're wrong about the oral cultures and their propensity to generate myth. If you're curious about the whole issue I suggest picking up a book and seeing the arguments they make for yourself. The people studying oral cultures, by the way, are not Christians \u2013 and I don't see any bias behind their work. However, I'm not an expert so I can't really add much to this discussion. I can just say that, based on my (hopefully objective) studies, oral cultures were well suited to pass down the essential truths of Jesus' message, devoid of corruption, and that message is mostly represented accurately in the gospels.\n\n&gt; It is easy for me to think that Jesus' divinity is pure legend, because pretty much everything Godly he did had been done previously. Countless older myths contain miracles such as virgin births, walking on water, turning water to wine, even resurrections after 3 days. It is clear we have since thrown into Christianity many other religions' (mostly pagan) traditions, such as the Yule tree, Dec. 25, Easter(Ostara). Is it not possible that at the time of writing the gospels, that the writers would throw in myths and traditions from previous religions to achieve the same goals: to make it more palatable for pagans to adopt Christianity?\n\nAnother point a lot of people have made over the years. Without getting into a painfully long paper about all the various other myths and religious movements containing some kind of parallel with the Jesus movement, I will just say this: Some weak associations exist. But nothing like what is prostituted by people like Dawkins and other pop atheist arguments. There really were no significant parallels. I have looked at them all, and in my (again, hopefully objective) estimate, the Jesus movement was unique. I highly doubt that the early Christians could have formed their theology based on other myths existing at the time \u2013 there is just no chance. This [book](http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Legend-Historical-Reliability-Tradition/dp/0801031141) has a great chapter comparing all the myths that might have some parallel with Christian theology.

A *true Conservative* is always for small Govt, states' rights (decentralization), non interventionist foreign policy. \n\n&gt;perfect example of what Republicans (believe it or not) from Reagan on have done\n\nTrue, the Neocons who were at first Democrats, came in the Republican party in the Reagan years:\n\nhttp://zfacts.com/p/511.html\n\nFrom [this](http://www.amazon.com/Betrayal-American-Right-Murray-Rothbard/dp/1933550139) book:\n\n&gt;As for the liberal intellectuals, their role has been to serve as \u201ccorporate liberals,\u201d as weavers of sophisticated apologies to inform the masses that the rulers of the American corporate state are ruling on behalf of the \u201ccommon good\u201d and the \u201cgeneral welfare.\u201d The role of the corporate liberal intellectual in justifying the ways of the modern State to man is precisely equivalent to the function of the priest in the Oriental despotisms who convinced the masses that their Emperor was all-wise and divine.\n\n&gt;In the meanwhile, the Buckleyite right wing was progressively abandoning even its rhetorical devotion to libertarian ideals. For National Review and its associates had learned what they believed to be the lesson of the Goldwater rout; from that point on, the conservative movement would shed itself of any and all \u201cextremist\u201d elements, whether in domestic or foreign affairs, and move in a \u201cresponsible\u201d and \u201crespectable\u201d manner toward the seats of Power for which it had yearned for so many years. As the Pope, as well as the insult-comic of the movement, Bill Buckley presided over the excommunicating and purging from Conservatism of any and all elements that might prove embarrassing in its quest for respectability and Power: libertarians, Birchers, atheists, ultra-Catholics, Randians, anyone who might disturb Conservatism in its cozy sharing of political rule.\nApart from style, there is very little to distinguish, say, Bill Buckley from Sidney Hook, or Senator Tower from former Senator Dodd, despite the latter\u2019s more New Dealish voting record. On hawkish foreign policy, on aggrandizing militarism and the military- industrial complex, on crushing civil liberties and granting unchecked powers to the police, on aggrandizing Executive power and privilege\u2014in short, on the major problems of our time, the Conservatives and Liberals are in broad agreement. And even their seeming disagreement on free-market versus liberal economics has virtually disappeared in the implicit acceptance by both conservatives and liberals of the New Deal-Great Society Corporate State neo-Mercantilist Consensus.\n\n&gt;And so we now face an America ruled alternately by scarcely differentiated conservative and liberal wings of the same state-corporatist system. Executive dictation, unending war in Vietnam, imperialism abroad and militarism and conscription at home, intimate partnership between Big Business and Leviathan Government. An increasing number of liberals are facing this critical failure and are recognizing that liberalism itself is to blame. They are beginning to see that Lyndon Johnson was absolutely correct in habitually referring to Franklin Roosevelt as his \u201cBig Daddy.\u201d\n\n&gt;Just as conservatives and liberals have effectively blended into a consensus to uphold the Establishment, so what America needs now\u2014and can have\u2014is a counter-coalition in opposition to the Welfare-Warfare State.\n\nAll the Big Govt freaks (including the Nazis, Fascists, Communists) are the extreme LEFT wing, at the extreme RIGHT are the anarchists (the opposite of Big Govt). The Socialists are left, the Social-Democrats are center left, the (true) Conservatives are center-right, the Libertarians, right.

I don't know much about Hardboiled Wonderland, but I would definitely be interested in reading it.\n\nI posted a couple Murakami recommendations in the other thread - here's what I posted:\n\nI'm recommending [Norwegian Wood](http://www.amazon.com/Norwegian-Wood-Haruki-Murakami/dp/0375704027/ref=pd_sim_b_10) or [After the Quake](http://www.amazon.com/After-Quake-Stories-Haruki-Murakami/dp/0375713271/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1241215823&amp;sr=8-1) or really anything by Haruki Murakami. I'd never really heard of him until recently, but he's quickly become one of my favorite writers. His prose is simple but beautiful, his stories rich and complex.\n\nAfter the Quake is a slim set of six haunting, evocative short stories set in 1990s Japan. It's really hard to describe this set of stories, as they are fairly varied, but they are often intimate, often dream-like. The situations are sometimes strange but the characters deeply human. There's an air of instability that pervades the stories - all occur in the aftermath of the 1995 earthquake, although none of the stories directly deal with the event. As I said, it's really hard to describe what the book is about, but let me just say this: when I finished it it gave me a legitimate twelve-hour high. It's really an excellent short story collection. If you want to know more, [here's the New York Times review of it](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/18/books/a-shock-to-the-system.html).\n\nNorwegian Wood is a novel about college students in 1960s Tokyo. I'm going to have to urge you to absolutely not read either of the editorial reviews on Amazon, as both contain plot details that don't occur until towards the end of the novel. The [New York Times review](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/24/books/rubber-souls.html) is fairly safe, but don't read the last paragraph. The story is really emotionally engaging, and Murakami's prose is just absolutely brilliant in this one. If you don't believe me, drop by a bookstore and read the first section. One of the greatest intros to any book I've ever read. The rest of the book is also incredible.\n\nI actually just went back through *After the Quake* earlier today. Let me just say that it is mindfuckingly brilliant.

It's made worse by the [self serving bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias).\n\nI think that's the biggest difference between conservatives (and libertarians) and liberals in general. The former believes that \"success\" is purely a function of hard work. The latter believes that hard work is a necessary *but insufficient* condition for success. Liberals acknowledge the role that pure luck plays.\n\nI find the example of Bill Gates to be a powerful one. At first glance, he got where he is because he worked hard. But he had a lot of factors helping him along the way. He was born in the right year such that when he'd be in his early 20's when the PC revolution hit. If he was younger he'd have missed it, if he was older he'd likely have already been occupied with something else (It's not a coincidence that so many of the PC billionaires like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Bill Joy, and several others were born within months of each other in 1955). His parents were upper middle class and were able to send him to one of the very few high schools in the country that had a computer, that he was able to use for free to learn to program. He was gifted with intelligence. His parents were well off enough that he was well fed and sheltered and could explore these things rather than have to work to feed his family or take care of siblings.\n\nHe worked hard to get where he is, but that's not the same thing as saying anyone who worked equally hard could have done it.\n\nAnd when you look, you'll find many of these same factors appear in normal people's lives. The comfortably middle class often had a lot of advantages and opportunities that the working poor never had.\n\n(Malcolm Gladwell just wrote an excellent book on the subject called [*Outliers*](http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017922).

Statistical procedures determine which of these answers is to be chosen.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;It is important to understand that negative results, where the experiment does not support the hypothesis, are valuable. Knowing what is not correct can be as as useful as knowing what is correct. Ideally, if the hypothesis is worth testing and the test was done well, then it is an important study and worth sharing with the scientific community. Whether the results are positive or negative does not determine the value of the research.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;It reality, however, it often is easier to get a study with positive results published, so scientists may feel pressure to get results that support the hypothesis. This attitude is fine if the scientist gets negative results, then uses insight from that experiment to revise the hypothesis and do a new experiment. It is wrong, though, if positive results are obtained by altering the data... or by altering the hypothesis after the experiment is completed so that it appears that positive results were achieved. Such a \"*post hoc* hypothesis\" is wrong because the experiment was not designed to test it, and the conclusions therefore might be erroneous.\"\r\n\r\nLee, Jeffrey A., 2000, *The Scientific Endeavor: A Primer on Scientific Principles and Practice*, San Francisco, Addison Wesley Longman, Inc., p. 48","distinguished":null,"edited":true,"parent_id":"t3_8ie95","author":"lostraven","archived":true,"ups":3}

It's not exactly \"time spent eating\" but it's related.\n\nIn a nutshell, it has to do with food culture. When you sit down at the end of the day for a family dinner, it doesn't just increase the amount of *time* you spend eating, it impacts the how and what you eat.\n\nFirst, you likely cooked the meal, which means it's not fast food. I recall one statistic that Americans eat 20% of their meals in their car - which explains a lot of this. Second, you eat slower, because you're talking and enjoying the company. Eating slower is part of the equation, because feeling full is a delayed reaction. Further, in cultures that have preserved this tradition of communal meals, there are other things that they tend to do - small portions, no seconds, no snacking between meals. The social cues about how much to eat stop any one person from eating too much - these are absent when eating alone.\n\nIn short, cultures on the low end of the obesity scale spend more time eating less, enjoying it more, and eating cooked meals according to food traditions that date back thousands of years. Americans by contrast spend a little time stuffing their face full of processed crap that wouldn't have even been recognized as food a hundred years ago.","retrieved_on":1425965846,"archived":true,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh55","id":"c09dywr","controversiality":0,"parent_id":"t3_8ibi6","subreddit":"food","created_utc":"1241658071","score":1,"gilded":0}

The prophesy specifically states that the kingdom of God will appear before the people who are standing there listening to the prophecy die. troffle stated in his comment that the Kingdom of God has not appeared therefore the prophesy is false. \n\nBut perhaps troffle has not seen the Kingdom of God because he doesn't know what to look for. Afterall, What is a Kingdom? A kingdom (or any nation) is nothing more than a body of laws. In the case of a Kingdom these laws all stem from the King and are expressed in his word. In the case of democracies the laws stem from the people (or their representatives) and are usually expressed ad nauseum  :)  Here is a book from amazon that explains this in detail http://www.amazon.com/Eight-Kingdoms-then-there-was/dp/1892112620/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1241690157&amp;sr=1-1\n\nDid the United States of America exist before the end of hostilities with England in 1814 at the end of the war of 1812. 1814 was the year in which all contention over the existence of the USA was settled. The country of the USA was established in 1776, but only on paper, a legal document drafted by the representatives of the country. It had no real estate or other possessions that were not contended over by the British. So the Americans said \"See we have a new law, and we are a new country\" the Britsh said \"No\" and the war was on. \n\nThe official historical view is that the USA existed when the Declaration of Independance was signed. But at that time the USA had nothing....no real estate, no money, no army, no President, nothing but a piece of paper. \n\nIn the biblical account. Jesus spends three years telling people what the laws of the Kingdom of God are and that it will be established (or coming) soon. At the end of the three years after all the laws have been declared, they then need to be enacted, validated, brought into being somehow. They are established by the death and resurrection of Jesus. It is this event which confirms the law just like the signatures on the Declaration of Independance. At this moment in time the Kingdom of God is established it now exists, but it has no real estate, no money etc...just law. It does have a King, but the King is not in residence, that does not make the kingdom go away, nor does it make the King not be King, it just means he is not in his Kingdom yet. Much like King Richard of England who left England to fight the Crusades, He was still King of England even though he wasn't in England. England still existed even though its King was in another country.\n\nMost people make the mistake of equating the prophesy in Luke with the second coming of Jesus, but that is an entirely separate event. The prophesy just mentions the Kingdom of God, not the King. \n\nSo when you are looking to see the Kingdom of God, what should you expect to see? A body of laws. We have them, they are called the New Testament and are described in the 1st four books of the \"New Testament\" in the Bible. The law has been established, The Kingdom of God is here.....now we await the King.","ups":-1,"downs":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qh2p","id":"c09e9xw","retrieved_on":1425965990,"archived":true,"parent_id":"t1_c09e91p","controversiality":0,"score":-1,"gilded":0,"subreddit":"atheism","created_utc":"1241692431"}

It's discussing the part of Reflections on the Psalms that deals with what Lewis terms \"Second Meanings\" --- aka that Old Testament authors seemed to utter things that anticipate Christ. In what sense did they, or might they, have known about Christ, if at all?\n\nThe full essay is in [this 4-volume CS Lewis essay collection](http://www.amazon.com/C-Lewis-Four-Volumes-Perspectives/dp/0275991164).\n\n**Lewis\u2019 View of Scripture**\n\n**Second Meanings**\n\nUp until this point, Lewis has been exploring different themes that struck him in the Psalms, from what troubled him to what pleased him. Now he turns to something \u201cfar more difficult.\u201d He has attempted to read the Psalms as he imagines the poets intended, with whatever tools of analysis he has had at his disposal (i.e. comparisons with other mythologies). But, as Lewis notes, \u201c\u2026this of course is not the way in which they have chiefly been used by Christians.\u201d49 The Psalms have been believed to contain hidden, or extra meanings of which that the writers were unaware. These extra meanings often pertain to the incarnation, passion, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus, and the redemption of man. The entire Old Testament has been read in this way, and the modern mind should be on full alert at this kind of reading. If the interpretive floodgates are haphazardly opened, then one will be able to read whatever he wants into a text, and perspectives lose their value. To avoid this problem, Lewis offers some memorable analogies to define his perspective on the so-called second meanings.\n\nThe first is a story of a fire that supposedly came about in Roman public baths. A user of the baths had complained earlier in the day that the water was not hot enough, and had received the reply from the worker that it would soon be hot enough. Lewis claims that if we suppose that there was no scheme to set fires, that it was a complete accident, then we find the worker\u2019s words to have, though accidentally, taken on a new meaning, a meaning \u201cmore importantly true\u201d than the worker could have ever guessed or predicted or intended.50\n\nLewis moves on to more robust examples in hopes of clearly demonstrating his distinct idea of what a second meaning is. He is apt to point out that he is not talking about pure, God-inspired prophecy, nor is he speaking of absolute coincidences. He is arguing that writers of such words, which take on a greater truth later of which they were not aware of at the time of writing, are rooted in reality, and so their words are congenial to the later, larger meaning. The reality surrounding the meanings is the same. In other words, the writers of these statements that have second meanings are not explicitly prophesying, but neither are they talking about something altogether different or unrelated from what their words eventually come to mean.\n\nTo exemplify this, Lewis imagines three scenarios. The first is that of a holy man, inspired by God, prophesying the details of a creature to be found on a distant planet. If we were to find such a creature on such a planet, it would be evidence that the prophet speaks the truth, and that we should consider whatever else he has to say. The second is a fiction writer who wildly and randomly creates a creature that inhabits some made up planet --- it is all fabricated with no attempt to consider reality. If we later find this kind of creature on this kind of planet, we shall consider it a wild accident. The third example is an accomplished biologist who demonstrates a relationship between an animal and its environment by imagining a hypothetical animal in a hypothetical environment. Later we find such an animal on such an environment, and we do not consider the occurrence a strict accident. It was through intelligence, investigation, and insight that this biologist was able to say something that turned out to match with the reality, though the biologist\u2019s lecture did not guarantee that this creature and this environment actually existed. Instead, it was a logical consequence of the analysis of how this world works. The reality behind the existence of the creature and the planet was also the reality that informed the biologist in creating his lecture about the creature and the planet.51\n\nIt is in this way that Lewis views the second meanings used by Christians in reading the Old Testament or in reading other, pagan sources. He believes they are to some degree rooted in a truth that enables them to speak about things they do not completely know about. In the case of the biologist, just because he is able to make a realistic prediction based on a type of animal and type of environment does not mean that such an animal and such a planet exist, but merely that it would not contradict with reality if they did.\n\n**For a more urgent example, Lewis turns to Plato who, in his Republic, is meditating on righteousness. Plato argues that in order to imagine righteousness in its essence, one has to strip it of the things that are brought with it (like honor, or popularity). Lewis then notes what Plato says next:**\n\n**\"He asks us therefore to imagine a perfectly righteous man treated by all around him as a monster of wickedness. We must picture him, still perfect, while he is bound, scourged, and finally impaled (the Persian equivalent of crucifixion).\"52**\n\nTo Lewis, this example and the biologist example are on a different level than the example of the Roman bath fire or an earlier example like Virgil\u2019s approach to a nativity narrative. The worker in the bath was not thinking about anything like arson, but \u201cPlato is talking, and knows he is talking, about the fate of goodness in a wicked and misunderstanding world.\u201d53 He isn\u2019t musing on something entirely different than the kind of suffering Christ would endure, even though he was himself unaware of this.\n\nIt should be stressed again that Lewis is differentiating between evidence and perspective. He isn\u2019t arguing that we should take these second meanings to be proofs of Christianity. It must not be forgotten that this is not a book of apologetics. Instead, this second meanings concept is a perspective taken up by a Christian in reading pre-Christian texts like the Old Testament and Plato\u2019s Republic. It is defined by a belief that the writers of things that carry second meanings, like arguably Plato in the example above, have some glimpse of reality, however dim or limited, that is revealed fully in the life and works of Christ, both as Creator and as Redeemer.\n\nLewis\u2019 reflections are also influenced by a kind of eschatology that comes with a Christian worldview. I mean eschatology here not as in how one reads Revelation in anticipation of the end of the world, but as in a view of history as a progression \u2013 from a past, towards a future. By believing God\u2019s hand to be at work through history to reveal truth, Lewis feels free to think about God\u2019s truth as it is revealed to man over time, instead of thinking of the Bible as a finished book that simply fell out of the sky.

Only carbohydrates (which are converted to blood sugar rapidly by the digestive system) have an appreciable impact on insulin for most people.  Insulin is the hormone that drives fat accumulation in everyone, and its malfunction leads to diabetes in people with chronically elevated levels.\n\nThe other problem is that insulin increases hunger.  So meals high in carbohydrates make us feel less full, on a calorie-per-calorie basis, as compared to meals low in carbohydrates.  Thus eating carbohydrates in excess tends to be a vicious cycle that leads to eating more.  On the other hand, fat and protein are satiating, and it's very difficult to overeat on them (most people simply won't want to, even given the opportunity).\n\n[For a lot more info](http://www.amazon.com/Good-Calories-Bad-Gary-Taubes/dp/1400040787).","distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_mouw","edited":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"gilded":0,"controversiality":0,"parent_id":"t1_c09fei5","archived":true,"created_utc":"1241802210","downs":0}

Here Mc Coy's cautious approach is paticularly damning in its findings. In a brief but telling conclusion, CIA policy is indicted for protecting drug lords in the name of national security, and for directly contradicting Drug Enforcement Agency's efforts to interdict major traffickers. Worse, he sees a growing tolerance for narcotics as an informal weapon of covert warfare whose trajectory now extends beyond Cold War confines. Considering the evidence amassed of at least indirect CIA complicity in a variety of hot spots, such conclusions are hardly overblown. However, his hope for both a reformed CIA and domestic War on Drugs are, it would seem, tenuous at best, given the global size of wealth and power that is at stake. As his book has shown, Cold War or no, the political economy of illegal narcotics, with its often useful underworld connections and expanded instruments of repression, is simply too powerful a tool for empire builders of any stripe to surrender.\"","score_hidden":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"archived":true,"created_utc":"1241997494","name":"t1_c09h3g7","distinguished":null,"link_id":"t3_8jd4n","author_flair_text":null,"author":"NoFixedAbode","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","parent_id":"t1_c09gyrd","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1425967530,"id":"c09h3g7","ups":7,"edited":true,"score":7,"downs":0}

There are some readily available, but because the subject matter is so expansive, they're rarely very much good.  Huston Smith wrote a book called [The World's Religions: Our Great Wisdom Traditions][1] which is highly regarded, but I can't vouch for it personally.  I have read his [Islam: A Concise Introduction][2], which is, unless I'm mistaken, extracted from *The World Religions*, and it was interesting and informative, so they may tend to stand in support of his reputation.  One caution, though: it would seem, based on his having written [Forgotten Truth: The Common Vision of the World's Religions][3], that he's an advocate of the idea that all religions basically espouse the same message.  If that's true, then so much the better for his work.  If it isn't true, though, then that perspective may bias his other writings, with the result that he may tend to minimize important distinctions between different religious traditions.\n\nBeyond that, though, I'd say your best bet is to look for different books on each tradition.  Time consuming, I know -- believe me, I *know* -- but your understanding of religion is less likely to be corralled by a single author's bias or limitations that way.\n\n[1]: http://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Religions-Great-Wisdom-Traditions/dp/0062508113\n[2]: http://www.amazon.com/Islam-Concise-Introduction-Huston-Smith/dp/0060095571/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1242051302&amp;sr=1-17\n[3]: http://www.amazon.com/Forgotten-Truth-Common-Vision-Religions/dp/0062507877/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1242051291&amp;sr=1-12","parent_id":"t1_c09hhzy"}

The problem we are facing, is that 'particles' and 'waves' are metaphors, and they have limits.

{"score":11,"ups":11,"retrieved_on":1425968434,"subreddit":"bicycling","distinguished":null,"parent_id":"t3_8jmyf","downs":0,"body":"Last summer I rode from San Francisco to Pueblo, CO on the Adventure Cycling Association's [Western Express Route](http://www.adventurecycling.org/routes/westernexpress.cfm), so I somewhat know what I am talking about. I did about 1600 miles in 22 days. I kind of wanted to go all the way across the country, but I had an accident coming down a mountainside in Colorado, destroying my bike and necessitating stitches. So Advice #1: Be careful of any patches of gravel when you are traveling at high speed on a winding road! (Gravel is extra likely to be on the road after a rain when it might have been washed off the mountainside onto the road.) Your traction can very quickly go to almost zero when you need it the most on a sharp turn.\r\n\r\n#2: I would get the ACA maps for the Western Express portion of your route, at least. This is pretty much non-negotiable in my opinion. Fuck, I'll send you my maps. The deserts of Nevada and Utah are VAST and HOT. The population density is comparable to that of the Sahara Dessert according to my world map. The ACA maps are awesome because they have so much info: where camp sites are (w phone numbers), what towns have gas stations, grocery stores, restaurants, elevation profiles (important for planning your days), and other great stuff. You will encounter only one town per day going through the dessert. Following the ACA route will also greatly increase your chances of running into other touring cyclists, which should be fun.\r\n\r\nACA maps might not be necessary for the eastern part of the ride because of the greater population density, but I have no experience with that.\r\n\r\n#3: Be prepared for days of (potentially extreme) discouragement. Life on the road can be intensely emotional, both positively and negatively, compared to your regular life. Don't let the bad days get you down.\r\n\r\n#4: If you possibly can, I would change your schedule to allow more time. Even just 50 days instead of 41 would make a big difference. 41 days is a fairly frenetic pace for loaded touring across the country unless you are REALLY fit on the bike. Besides, you want to be able to enjoy the sites along the way, not feel like you have to push hard for miles every day. Nothing ruins a journey like a harsh deadline looming at the end of it. The mountains and hills you'll encounter might make your pace more difficult to achieve than you expect.\r\n\r\n#5: Stealth camping can be both convenient and money-saving. It can also be stressful. The difference is basically determined by population density/availability of wide-open public lands. See [here](http://strangemaps.wordpress.com/2008/06/17/291-federal-lands-in-the-us/) for an important illustration. I didn't spend a cent on lodging my entire trip; I stealth camped the whole way (except for two nights when my dad was along with me and he bought us motel rooms). I HATED trying to find a stealth campsite when I was in populated areas; this was probably the worst part of the trip for me but I had to do it because I'm so poor I can't even afford proper campsites. But stealth camping was awesome when I was in unpopulated areas because there was a lot of public land around, not many people to worry about, and some great scenery. And the best part is that you don't have to plan your day around making it from Campsite A to Campsite B before dark. You ride as far as you feel like, and set up camp, even if the last campsite is 30 miles back and the next site is 40 miles ahead.\r\n\r\n#6: I didn't bring cooking gear, and I don't regret. My diet, which I recommend, consisted mainly of foods that were cheap, took about 90%+ of their calories from carbs with a 50-50 mix of complex carbs and sugars, available at gas stations along the way. Examples: Pop Tarts, Oreos, cinnamon rolls. Peanut butter on bread with honey is also good. Bought 2 liter jugs of Hawaiian Punch instead of Gatorade. $5 footlongs at Subway were my treats that I tried to eat daily. Did not bring cooking equipment and did not miss it. At the end of the day I was so pooped I think the last thing I would have wanted to do was cook a hot meal for myself (and take the time to do that). I was happy to set up my tent, eat a few gas station bear claws, and hit the sack.\r\n\r\n#7: Speaking of equipment... you will probably end up shipping home a large amount of the stuff you bring along, unless you are incredibly, improbably wise in your packing the first time around.\r\n\r\n#8: One of my favorite items I brought along: a sponge for... that's right... sponge bathing. This is a brilliant way to keep yourself from stinking to high hell every time you walk into a library or wherever you need to go, yet you can do it without a shower or even much water, and you can even do it with your cycling shorts on in a public park (discreetly). Keeping your crotch clean should also reduce the risk of having painful irritation that will make your life on the saddle much less enjoyable.\r\n\r\n#9: Another item I liked: my rear-view mirror. I had one that mounted to my glasses, although they also sell some mounted on handlebars or helmets. This made it easy for me to have an idea of what traffic was behind me without having to crane my neck and back around to look behind me (which can be both uncomfortable and dangerous).\r\n\r\nWell, I could probably go on forever. I might add more later, but for now I should probably go to bed.\r\n\r\nOthers have mentioned: crazyguyonabike.com, bikeforums.net. These are generally great sites. I would also recommend [Ken Kifer's Bike Pages](http://www.kenkifer.com/bikepages/) for info and inspiration. He has a [survey](http://www.kenkifer.com/bikepages/survey/nov01.htm) he took about bike touring that I find useful, particularly question #20 about what kind of equipment failures people had. A lot of people spend a lot of energy worrying about equipment failures, but it doesn't seem like they're all that common (especially if you have a quality bike in good condition).\r\n\r\n[The Essential Touring Cyclist](http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Touring-Cyclist-Complete-Traveler/dp/0071360190) is a great book about everything you could need to know about bike touring; highly recommended. (I read the first edition; the Amazon link is to the 2nd edition but I'm sure it's even better.)","author":"FountainsOfDave","gilded":0,"link_id":"t3_8jmyf","id":"c09ibcq","subreddit_id":"t5_2qi0s","created_utc":"1242118517","author_flair_css_class":"us-ca","archived":true,"controversiality":0,"name":"t1_c09ibcq","score_hidden":false,"edited":true,"author_flair_text":"2011 Dahon Mu P8 folding bike"}

A band like Radiohead probably couldn't exist in that context.  The emphasis would have to shift towards live performance, and recording -- even for free distribution on the internet -- would be tantamount to an advertising cost.\n\nAnd actually I'm sort in favor of that system, but I'd imagine I'm a rare breed in that regard.  Most music fans these days seem to like having studio albums made with a variety of recording and production techniques.  It should be considered incumbent upon those that do to support the studio system or something like it -- if for no other reason than that it's self-defeating to cheat your own system.\n\n&gt; Same thing for books \u2013 newspapers and magazines are practically all online now, or on their way.\n\nWhich I'd say is a potentially bad thing.  There's simply not the same sort of economic model available to it.  It's hard to imagine something like Bob Woodward's [The Final Days][1] being written on the economic model of internet distribution.  The sort of research and access involved is simply too costly.  So again, by trading on a system, we trade on the sort of information that's available to us.\n\n&gt; I read in a recent JJ Abrams interview that he thinks there won\u2019t be many more big budget shows like Lost because the economic model of television has shifted too far from the \u201c3 min commercial break\u201d model.\n\nI think he's probably right as far as broadcast television goes.  Cable channels like Showtime seem to have worked out a viable (and arguably superior) model based on subscription, and it's plausible that the collapse of commercial broadcast television will throw more emphasis their way.  Internet broadcast television is still working out the kinks in its economic model, but the result is almost bound to be more cheaply made shows with extremely limited commercial interruption, ie. Hulu.  All but about 5% of the television I've given a damn about in the last 5 years have come from Showtime or HBO, so I'm not particularly worried about the direction television's going.\n\n[1]: http://www.amazon.com/Final-Days-Carl-Bernstein/dp/0743274067/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1242159757&amp;sr=8-1","downs":0,"name":"t1_c09itjg","score":2,"score_hidden":false,"controversiality":0,"author":"blackstar9000","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"retrieved_on":1425968738}

These two aspects play off each other to magnify the intensity of the symptoms. Once you understand why the physical symptoms occur and learn how you can control them, and you can identify how the physical symptoms can trigger thoughts that make your sensations worse, you can begin to interrupt the spiral that leads you down the hellish path to a full-on panic attack.  \n\nDo note that some physical conditions can mimic the symptoms of a panic attack, so you should start by ruling out mitral valve prolapse or some other general medical condition as a trigger. A simply physical exam should be adequate. While you\u2019re there, ask for a referral for a PhD level psychotherapist who specializes in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders. This will really be a specialist--as incredibly effective as CBT is for anxiety disorders (particularly Panic Disorder), there are relatively few therapists who are trained in this approach. So do make sure to find somebody who does this a lot. \u201cThe one guy in town who sees all the panic disorder cases and does CBT and nothing but CBT\u201d is who you want to see. \n\nSimple talk therapy is not going to help. Okay, it might be palliative (help make you feel better in the short term) and to the extent that this helps you reduce your base stress level to something more manageable (say, down to 35-40 on a 0-100 scale--you\u2019re spending a lot of time north of 60, aren\u2019t you), it might be of some use, but Brother, what you REALLY need to do is go to \u201cAnxiety School!\u201d This is what a psychologist trained in CBT will do with you!\n\nA lot of posts here have described methods to reduce the physiological arousal that you are experiencing. Not wrong, but again, these approaches are palliative. We need to solve your problem, and treating the symptoms (with weed, exercise, Xanix, etc.) is not addressing the underlying cause. Temporarily reducing your physiological arousal in the \u201cnow\u201d leaves you vulnerable in the future. So while lifestyle changes (especially exercise and caffeine control) are good, and will help to reduce your current, chronic 60+ level of stress, there is a more complete solution available to you. \n\nThe problem is not the \u201cuncontrollable\u201d physiological arousal. The main problem is your mind\u2019s impulsive, catastrophic interpretation of what are actually benign physiological symptoms. Once your mind interprets a benign sensation (such as a racing heart, not being able to catch your breath, feeling \u201cwoozy,\u201d experiencing depersonalization, or numbness in your lips or extremities) as an Emergency Situation, thus inducing release of adrenaline, you are basically on your way. \n\nHere is the cycle: \n\nBenign physiological symptom -&gt; \nCatastrophic interpretation of what the physiological symptom means -&gt; \nRelease of adrenaline -&gt; \nFight-or-flight response -&gt; \nIntensification of physical symptoms -&gt; \nIntensification of fears -&gt; \nIntensification of adrenaline response --&gt; repeat\n(repeat until body reserve of adrenaline is depleted).  \n\nThe benign symptoms are caused by a variety of things. For example, if racing heart is your biggest trigger, than you can reliably create that trigger by drinking too much coffee or Coke (also, it just fluctuates throughout the day--sometimes it can even skip a beat. Normal.). But if your mind associates a racing heart beat with your dad\u2019s heart attack when he was your age, that heart beat gets interpreted as an Emergency Situation and off you go: \u201cJesus! I\u2019m having a heart attack!\u201d\n\nIf the benign symptom of breathlessness (technically known as \u201cdyspnea\u201d) is a big trigger for you, you can reliably create this symptom with shallow, rapid breathing. Got a big gut? Poor posture? Chronic muscle tension? Spend the day bent over coding? All these contribute to crappy breathing habits, which will, in turn, cause shallow rapid breaths, which will, in turn, result in \u201cchronic hyperventilation syndrome\u201d which, in turn, keeps you right on the brink of experiencing dyspnea. Stand up suddenly and feel dizzy, stop your crappy breathing momentarily as you focus on something, and that little blood gas balance gets tripped and you just might find yourself \u201cgasping for breath.\u201d Hmmm... that sounds serious--must be an Emergency Situation! \n\nBoom! Now you\u2019re got adrenaline coursing through your veins: It\u2019s fight-or-flight! Cognition shuts down, you don\u2019t know what happened, but YOU CAN\u2019T BREATH and maybe even have to GET OUT OF HERE! Comes now your full-blown panic attack.\n\nThat bit about cognition is worth remembering: FIght-or-flight evolved to save us from predators. Cognition is a hinderance to rapid action in this situation (you are not going to be able to reason with the saber toothed tiger, right?). So remember that the first thing to go in a panic attack is rational thought. \n\nBut once you learn the physiological reason of whatever benign triggers you have, you\u2019ll find that you can keep your rational mind in play during a panic attack--and then it\u2019s not a panic attack any more. In fact, it might just become the observation that your heart is racing after that third can of Jolt. \n\nIt\u2019s also important to understand that you are almost certainly unaware of which benign physiological symptoms are your primary triggers, nor are you aware of what you are doing to cause these symptoms to \u201ctip over\u201d into the \u201ccausing catastrophic interpretation\u201d zone. For example, if you are chronically hyperventilating, you don\u2019t know that you are doing this, you just know that sometimes \u201cout of the blue\u201d you feel that you can\u2019t catch your breath. You don\u2019t know why or how this is happening, so of course it is confusing and frightening. Why wouldn\u2019t you experience that as an Emergency Situation?\n\nWhen you do experience dyspnea, remember that breathing into a paper bag helps. It helps because it increases the concentration of CO2 in your blood, which turns off the dyspnea trigger. That\u2019s it. All that breathlessness is just about the balance of your blood O2 and CO2, and if you slow down and deepen your breathing, you are doing the same thing as breathing into a bag. That\u2019s why slowing your breathing works (as has been recommended in other posts). \n\nNow: If simply breathing into a bag, or slowing your breathing, absolutely eliminates this dyspnea problem, is it really an Emergency Situation? \n\nOf course not! It really isn\u2019t an Emergency Situation, but your mind is still trained to respond this way--that symptoms SCARES YOU. So the way to eliminate that conditioned fear is to: 1) Create dyspnea at will, and 2) Turn it off. Once you can repeatedly and reliably create this symptom, and turn it off, your mind becomes untrained to fear this benign physiological symptom. And then you will find that when you experience dyspnea, rather than fearing loss of control and wondering if you are dying, you will say to yourself, \u201cMan, me and my crappy breathing! Okay, starting my long, slow breaths...\u201d\n\nNote that no therapist who knows anything is going to traumatize you by moving too fast in this stuff. It is unhelpful to trigger a panic attack in therapy until the person will reliably be able to control it. So don\u2019t get freaked by the above. Nothing is going to happen until you have the ability to control it. \n\nThat\u2019s just a sketch. \n\nThere is a lot more in CBT for Panic Disorder: Self-study of panic attacks (recording your first symptom [e.g., racing heart], your first thought [\u201cheart attack!\u201d], and the ensuing symptoms that occur. There is also relaxation practice (to gain practice at turning on the parasympathetic nervous system to relax you), symptom control practice (making and stopping yourself from feeling dizzy, experiencing dyspnea, racing heart, etc.), and a bunch of learning about how the body works and just what the hell is going on inside of you. You\u2019ll get good at charting panic attacks: Time of day, precipitating conditions, first symptom, first thought, additional symptoms and thoughts, and ultimately, the self-statements you use to control your fear and the physical control you exercised to turn off your symptoms. \n\nAt minimum, get this book:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Your-Anxiety-Panic-Treatments/dp/0195311353\n\nBut really, it will be better if you get into treatment with an excellent Cognitive Behavioral Therapist. Panic Disorder treatment will be their bread-and-butter. You are not alone, and many, many thousands have walked this path before and gotten over this with the right treatment. \n\nAnd one day, you\u2019ll start to feel that familiar, panicky sensation and say \u201cI\u2019m experiencing what used to be a panic attack\u201d and you\u2019ll know why the sensations started, and you\u2019ll know what really is going on. Your rational mind will stay awake, and you\u2019ll select a strategy to decrease your symptoms. In a minute or two, you\u2019ll get back to what you were doing. And you won\u2019t even notice that didn\u2019t have a panic attack!","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh1i"}

It includes interviews with people who opened up their relationship for various reasons\u2014some of which _were_ swingers; others felt that they still loved each other but could not fulfill each other sexually. \n\nIn any case it's worth examining your situation and not denying yourself happiness, life is short and it's a crime (against yourself) to spend it unhappy. Whatever happens, I hope things work out for you guys.\n\n//EDIT: I noticed a few downmods, I'd love to hear some well thought out dissenting views :)","name":"t1_c09jwwe","distinguished":null,"ups":4,"subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"retrieved_on":1425969438,"author_flair_text":null,"gilded":0,"controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","archived":true,"id":"c09jwwe","link_id":"t3_8k5an","edited":true,"downs":0,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"created_utc":"1242253616","parent_id":"t1_c09ju5a"}

I am far from a professional, though I am a dedicated amateur home chef, for what it's worth.  \n\nIt all depends what you are looking for.  If you are looking for a cheap nonstick skillet, you could go with the ['Simply Calphalon Nonstick 12\" Omelette Pan'](http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-Classic-Nonstick-Hard-Anodized-12-Inch/dp/B0001LO5G8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=home-garden&amp;qid=1242368276&amp;sr=1-2) that is rated as the #1 bargain nonstick by America's Test Kitchen / Cook's Illustrated.  I haven't used that one myself, but I trust the ATK reviews completely.  I have used one similar to [this](http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-Classic-Nonstick-Hard-Anodized-12-Inch/dp/B0001LO5G8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=home-garden&amp;qid=1242368276&amp;sr=1-2), and love the weight and build of it.  The helper handle comes in nice if you are ever doing anything with the pan very full (oven baked ziti for instance).   \n\nLately I find myself leaning more towards stainless steel for everything.  Not only do you get better cooking results because of the build up of fond (the brown bits in the bottom of the pan), it is also safer for you because there is no toxic coating like nonstick skillets.  I have the 8 and 10\" versions of [this](http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=5716483) and love them.  I plan on replacing my 12\" nonstick skillet with the one I linked to eventually.  I recommend this one because it is, like the super expensive All Clad lines, an aluminum core sandwiched between a stainless steel exterior.  This gives you the heat transfer and retention of aluminum, which is great, and the durable and chemically resistant finish of stainless.  If you do go this route, you will not be sorry.  You'll also not find a pan of this caliber unless you at least quadruple the price.  Unfortunately, not many stores carry them, Walmart is the only one I know of that consistently does.  \n\nCast iron is another solid choice, but one that will take a bit more work and care to clean and maintain.  You have to season them, and once you do you can't use soap on them.  Some chefs recommend stripping the seasoning if soap ever touches them because the film is porous.  I don't use mine often, but I know a lot of people swear by them.  I find that the only cast iron piece I use frequently is my dutch oven, and that my clad cookware is better for most things on the stove top.  \n\nAll of the pans I linked to are very good quality, and shouldn't need to be replaced any time soon if you treat them properly.

Supposedly an \"Egyptologist\", he was actually self-taught. Just like creationists and other fringe theorists, he came up with a wild idea and published a book about it, cherry-picking facts that supported it, ignoring facts that didn't, and making up most of the rest. His work was immediately seen as a joke when it was published, and it's even more of a joke today, as our understanding of Ancient Egypt grows.\n\nThen they base their research on books by one \"Acharya S\", titled Suns of God and The Christ Conspiracy. Both complete lunacy, ridiculed by mainstream science.

I've have hundreds of dog training books and have read many more; I think the single best book for you is Pat Miller's: [Love Your Dog, Train Your Dog](http://www.amazon.com/Positive-Perspectives-Love-Your-Train/dp/1929242158/ref=sr_1_4/183-5276648-7015950?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1242576569&amp;sr=1-4). The other dog training books Pat has written are excellent, too. Read them all. I buy her books in bulk to give away to people I love who have dogs.\n\nGet the video called [Puppy Kindergarten](http://www.dogwise.com/itemdetails.cfm?ID=DTB758) by Corally Burmaster. It's awesome, and will show you some great training techniques that apply even if you get an adult dog. I've linked to it at Dogwise, which is where dog trainers by specialty books and stuff.\n\nGo to the [Association of Pet Dog Trainers](http://apdt.com/) website, and find the trainers in your area. Call them. Interview them. Pick a good one, then explain that you don't have a dog yet, but would like to sit in on a whole set of beginner lessons, just to watch. Pay full price for this if you have to. You may learn great techniques. You'll also learn if the trainer is worth considering if you get a dog.\n\nDon't neglect socialization. Learn to recognize healthy play between dogs, and also how to recognize if one dog is unhappy with the way another is playing. (A good trainer can explain all this in detail.)\n\nGo visit doggy daycares if you have some in your area. Find a good one. Being able to leave you dog in daycare for a day here and there will help with socialization, and is great fun for the dog. If you work full time and the dog will be alone while you're at work, don't get a dog unless you can afford to have that dog in doggy daycare or happily occupied some other way. Being stuck alone at home all day long is horrible for most dogs.\n\nConsider a raw food diet. There are a bunch of good books on that - Carina Beth MacDonald's book, [Raw Dog Food: Make It Easy for You and Your Dog](http://www.amazon.com/Raw-Dog-Food-Make-Easy/dp/1929242093/ref=sr_1_1/192-1013578-1226304?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1242577006&amp;sr=1-1) is the best starting point.\n\nFinally, before selecting a dog, figure out what you want in a dog. You want a dog to stick near you in the woods, to come when called even when temptation is near? Realize that some breeds have been bred for this kind of behaviour, and while other breeds have been bred to be headstrong and work independently. Learn about breed characteristics befor you make your choice. If you have a clear idea of what you want in a dog, a breeder or animal shelter staff-person can help you make a good choice."}

That's really the primary reason to work on tightening the feedback loop between the users articulating what they want and the developers showing any given iteration to them. It's also the motivation behind the process of [Domain-Driven Design](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215).

{"author_flair_css_class":null,"body":"Modern human populations are akin to sub specie divisions. The hybridization of these sub species also creates new sub species.\r\n\r\n&gt; Sarich and Miele, both respected academicians, challenge the much-hyped, popular notion of race as an illusion, or mere social construct. Instead, they contend that significant human racial differences exist. Those differences are being increasingly identified and quantified via medical research and law-enforcement techniques, most notably in DNA testing, which has led to convictions and acquittals. Inquiries into the genetic influences behind racial differences in educational achievement and intelligence, despite inflammatory resistance, are justified by cost-benefit analyses, the authors contend. Assessing the future of racial politics in the U.S and internationally, Sarich and Miele offer three scenarios: meritocracy with race-sensitive safety valves (which they prefer), affirmative action or quotas, and rising resegregation and ethnopolitics. This is an important work, despite its conservative inferences, that challenges both the existence and the value of America's obsession with color blindness.

Here, le Creuset salespersons can't care less about the product they sale). I used to be a chef alongside my dad in his restaurant and he earned a 3 Michelin stars. This for the background.\n\nAnyway. Le Creuset rocks for certain tasks, such as braising, for which I recommend vehemently this [book](http://www.amazon.com/All-About-Braising-Uncomplicated-Cooking/dp/0393052303). If you want to do things like rabbits in wine, 6 hours leg of lamb, coq au vin. Then le Creuset is your pot. Oh, I forgot to mention that their pot, if you pick a large one, can make insanely [good bread](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/dining/08mini.html?scp=2&amp;sq=le%20creuset%20bread&amp;st=cse).\n\nThe secret of these pots is the control of the temperature in a modern oven which usually suffers temperature fluctuations impairing the slow cooking processes. Also, the iron cast works itself as an oven, distributing the heat all around, not just in the bottom. These pots merit love and a little bit of knowledge in thermodynamics. For instance, you never heat these pot full blast, but half dial; the pot hates it, but stores the heat for you. It thus conserves energy, since this heat is not wasted away. In fact, 20 full minutes after one turned off the flame, the temperature inside the pot remains the same.\n\nFor \u201clive cooking\u201d, this is a different matter. Now, it really depends on your budget and your desire for perfect technical responses. All clad is what you need. It means that a layer of aluminum or copper is sandwiched between two layers of stainless steal. Why? because copper and aluminum are both superb heat conductors but both are crazy reactive to acids such as your tomato sauces, lemons and wines. Aluminum goes further: its ions travel to your brains and can cause Alzheimer disease. Stainless steal alone is a poor heat conductor. To heat up 5 gallons of water at 1 ATM at 80F can take up to 35 minutes with such a pot. \n\nSure, having the copper coat on the bottom helps. But I do prefer heat being carried on up to the the lid of the pot. So, all clad is my stuff. Finally, stay away from teflon and 'castaflon', those nasty shit from Dupont. Ok, you have a egg to do in a hurry, no problem. A fish, you are scared it may stick? Alright then. But don't make it a habit. And only with middle dial and NO METAL utensils: Teflon is toxic once ingested.\n\nEdit: ok, my bad. copper is way more toxic than aluminum, and it's true that the link between aluminum and Alzheimer is not quite proven yet. Sorry guys, I typed a bit too fast. I'll \"stick\" to my words concerning Teflon. Sure, it won't kill you in an instant, but I won't trust a lifetime of usage from a company with a bad reputation concerning the environment.","subreddit":"Cooking","score_hidden":false,"gilded":0}

This usage applies to the international context as well, where the \"public good\" is used to refer to people in general, and where the state is viewed as being excessive in its protection of native business over foreign (rival) businesses.\n\nWhile you see the term used more on the conservative side, it **is** used by liberals to cast aspersions on specific conservative behaviors as well.  It is also used in general by libertarians against both liberals **and** conservatives, and it refers a very specific state of affairs.\n\nMethinks you knee-jerk by the negative connotations of the term without any understanding of its use or history.\n\nI will grant you, however, that folks such as Bill \"ORLY\" have been known to co-opt valid terminology for its jingoistic value -- which, again, disgusts me.\n\nBut please, do not throw the baby out with the bath-water.  \"Nanny statism\" is a valid aspersion within the appropriate context.

Don't overuse any substance - if you drink too much water in a certain amount of time you can die. Be constantly aware of yourself; feelings, ambitions, worries, thought patterns in general. Marijuana should ideally be used responsibly and in moderation with a responsible lifestyle. You might have to stop smoking so much and reflect on your situation.  \n\nThe benefits of cannabis are numerous and sometimes subtle, therefore for everyone there can be different effects and levels of effectiveness. If you are criticizing cannabis for not having \"long term benefit\"s then you are very off the mark on how to think about cannabis and it's uses.  The phrase \"Long term\" should always be thought of in context with your personal growth and maturity, health and wellbeing.  Personally using marijuana has aided my growth and maturity by providing me with varying angles of perspective on myself and others, ideas and concepts, feelings and emotions, that have led me to have realizations that have benefited my well being - hence growth and maturity.  Because it is illegal and medical science still knows too little about it your use will have to be on an \"experiment-experience-result\" basis, which means trying to be unbiased with humility and reason. \n\nGet the book [Secular Wholeness by David Cortesi](http://www.amazon.com/Secular-Wholeness-Skeptics-Paths-Richer/dp/155369175X) and begin to live an authentic, rational life that includes learning how to experience and enjoy blissful moments without the use of cannabis. You can still use it to reach certain states of being, which is fine, but remember, all in moderation!"}

{"body":"Change your Google search to \"strength training\" and \"powerlifting\". There are some good online resources too. You can get an excellent foundation using the [\"5x5\"](http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-ebook-download/) program at [Stronglifts](http://stronglifts.com/). \"5x5\" refers to five sets of each exercise, for five repetitions per set. Basically, when lifting heavy weights, the fewer repetitions the more you emphasize building strength, and the more repetitions you do you emphasize hyptertrophy (size). Most bodybuilding exercises use at least eight reps up to as many as twenty reps (beyond that, it's basically just cardio training). \n\nThere are some excellent books that I can recommend. One of the most popular for strength-training is [Starting Strength](http://www.amazon.com/Starting-Strength-2nd-Mark-Rippetoe/dp/0976805421/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1242994100&amp;sr=1-1), by Mark Rippetoe. His program is slightly different--3x5 instead of 5x5, but the basic philosophy is the same. You build strength best by doing compound exercises (i.e., they work multiple groups of muscles as opposed to isolation exercises that focus on only one muscle group). You'll find that the barbell squat, barbell deadlift, and barbell bench press are the foundation of just about every strength training program around. Another highly-respected author/trainer is Eric Cressey, and his book [Maximum Strength](http://www.amazon.com/Maximum-Strength-Strongest-Ultimate-Weight-Training/dp/1600940579/ref=pd_sim_b_4) is another excellent program. Cressey is well-known in the athletic field for his \"pre-hab\" and rehab work with injury recovery and prevention. \n\nI have all three books and recommend them all. They have more similarities than differences, and you can learn from each one. I follow the 5x5 Stronglifts program, but I've learned from the other authors too. Rippetoe, for example, has fifty-eight pages in his book just on the barbell squat. It's such an important exercise that he goes into great detail (lots of photos too) describing how to do it properly (and what not to do).

What we think is purpose is in fact evolution at play. Evolution doesn't have purpose, just like water doesn't have purpose, it just is.

I don't blieve that.\" Or I could say, \"microcreationism? Sounds plausible, but macrocreation?

Once you understand what all the settings do you'll find that it's more about creativity than numbers. Sometimes what might seem like the entirely wrong setting can make the best photo.\n\nI found Tom Ang's book [Fundamentals of Photography](http://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Photography-Essential-Handbook-Digital/dp/0375711570/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1243173005&amp;sr=1-4) really useful in explaining how the camera works and went poking around on the camera finding settings and stuff while I was reading.\n\nAlso, some tips based on your specific comments:\n\nF-stop refers to how 'wide' your lens is. There are literally blades inside the lens that close and open to allow less and more light to hit the sensor. Lower f-number = wider/more open lens. In low light you'll need a lower f-number (how wide open) or a longer shutter speed (how long it's open) or a higher ISO (sensitivity of the sensor) or a combination of those. There's not any math involved if you're using the priority modes. Choose an aperture and the camera will choose an appropriate shutter speed. If that shutter speed is too slow (eg, you aren't on a tripod and so the photo will come out terrible blurry) then increase the ISO.\n\nYellow photos... don't worry about it. That's white balance stuff, mostly. Make sure you shoot in RAW and fix it in Aperture or Lightroom or whatever you're using for post-processing. Auto-white-balance usually works well either on the camera or in your post-production, too.\n\nI'd go for a book on photography in general and then, IMHO, stick with aperture priority while you experiment. I find that shooting action is very difficult when just starting out and that's what shutter priority is mostly for. In aperture priority you control depth of field and the amount of light getting onto the sensor, this is fundamental stuff. So grab a book and also follow asw66's first comment about just walking around trying different settings. Go to a garden or really anywhere with subjects at different distances, pick a focal length and go from the lowest aperture you've got available to the highest in all your shots. Head home and go over all of these with a fine-tooth-comb. Put comments on them, write a blog post or something... whatever.\n\nSide note: I just noticed that you were looking for some help/discussion on the subject, but I don't have any serious critiques for the photo, I like it quite a lot.

Thus many of the initial stockades of isolated \"survivors\" became infected from inside - it only took one individual, terrified of the death sentence they'd effectively been handed and irrationally hoping their bite wasn't \"serious\", to pose as healthy  and gain entrance to the stockade; in this case the entire encampment was fucked.

It's more than that.\n\nI like Science Fiction.  I assume most people in this subreddit do as well.\n\nHollywood?  Hollywood *hates* science fiction.  Primarily because it's what those nerds in Vulcan ears watch, but also because it makes them scads of money and they don't quite know why so they *have* to make science fiction even though they'd much rather shove Beverly Hills Chihuahua down your throat.  \n\nI once had a conversation with [Larry Turman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0877274/) about John Carpenter's [The Thing.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787/)  I asked him why he mentioned every movie he'd ever worked on except that one in his [book.](http://www.amazon.com/So-You-Want-Be-Producer/dp/1400051665/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1243232595&amp;sr=8-1)  He said \"because it wasn't very good.  Also, it lost money.  Most people forget that.  Anyway.  I hate science fiction.  Except for Star Wars.  Although those last three movies - boy, what stinkers!\"\n\nWe were sitting in the George Lucas Building at USC.\n\nSo I've managed to claw my way up for the past eight years and I've got a bead on the kind of movie that everybody loves - after the fact - but that studios won't fucking touch because adore Blade Runner and Gattaca all you want, they were box office bombs.  And if I'm gonna do that, and if I'm really and truly going to throw a couple years of my life at this thing, I want to leave no stone unturned.\n\nIncidentally, there's no such thing as a \"prior art search\" in movies.  There's \"good artists borrow, great artists steal\" and \"if it's done well, it's an homage; if it's done badly it's a ripoff.\"  In screenwriting, meeting with the author is highly discouraged.  In directing, reading the goddamn book is highly discouraged.\n\nAnd by and large, I'm heartened and overwhelmed by the response to the above post.  I've got me some stuff to read and watch, a lot of which I hadn't heard of (and much of which I have).  I'm pleased that Bladerunner was politely suggested (if I couldn't quote Bladerunner chapter'n'verse I'd have no business attempting my career) and delighted that, unlike most /r/scifi posts, the whiny, bitter self-entitlement has been kept to a bare minimum.\n\nY'all are good people.

If you're just a couple of points short (or indeed if you meet the target), just keep doing practice LSATs.  If you're behind by a bit more - say, 10% behind your target percentile - go with a prep book.  Lower than that, and you might consider a prep course.\n\nSo yeah, your used study guide idea is a good one, I'm just recommending you do a diagnostic test first.\n\nI have no idea about the other stuff (I'm in Canada, so while we use the LSAT, our law school system is pretty different).

I think the political process is starting to work a bit, as people figure out how to get organized online more effectively. But if you're really interested, [here](http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/) is where you can find pretty much the state of the art in insurgent strategy. Best introduction would be the author's [book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471780790/ref=nosim/globalguerril-20).\n\nShort answer: low-risk, high-return attacks mostly against technological infrastructure. Small independent cells, communicating publicly and anonymously - Robb calls it \"open-source warfare.\" Rapid innovation, as a thousand independent cells try different things and publicize what works. \n\nThis sort of thing is happening in hotspots all over the world, and the more a country depends on centralized technology, the more vulnerable it is.\n\nThis is the most recent development of insurgent tactics, but even back to Mao it's been clear that insurgents can cause serious problems for a large military. Mao had his people snipe, drop their weapons, and melt into the civilian population. This puts the military in a no-win situation: either let the guy escape, or kill everyone in the area, turning their relatives into even more insurgents.\n\nAnyone who thinks the government can get away with mass murder of civilians, in an age when half the population carries an internet-connected video camera in their pockets, is just not being realistic. There are counterinsurgency methods the government can use, but overwhelming firepower plays no part in them, and the playing field is a lot more level than people think.\n\n","id":"c09tenp","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":"1243302901","subreddit_id":"t5_6"}

{"subreddit":"food","edited":true,"link_id":"t3_8nmw1","body":"My own tips that I would highly recommend are:\n\n*Get a nice big stainless steel skillet.  This would be your workhorse, and well worth the investment.  Tramontina Tri-ply Clad cookware is supposed to be as good as the top notch brand All-Clad, and can be had for a quarter of the price.   Whatever you do, don't buy a set.  \n\n*Buy a good set of knives.  Not a block mind you, a very specific set of knives.  The knives you will likely need are the following in this order:  Chef Knife, Paring Knife, Bread/Serrated Knife, Boning/Filet Knife.  I would recommend going with [Victorinox by Forschner](http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1243440367/ref=a9_sc_1?ie=UTF8&amp;search-alias=garden&amp;field-keywords=victorinox) because they are great knives and are dirt cheap.  \n\n*Try to stay away from single use, specific gadgets.  If you find that you make something a lot and could use something specific that will make your life easier then purchase it.  For example, my salad spinner was originally purchased for lettuces, but I know use it for preparing herbs, fruit, vegetables and even tofu.  I've got too many useless gadgets to list.\n\n*Above all, if you have any questions never hesitate to ask.  There are so many people here and elsewhere that are willing to help.  Do make sure you try to listen to those who know what they are talking about, and not just what is convenient, which leads me to my last bullet...\n\n*Be very picky about the recipes you find online and elsewhere.  Just because you spend real money on a book doesn't mean the recipes therein will be any good.  As others have mentioned Cooks Illustrated, and their sister publications and shows, have very solid and delicious recipes.  Alton Brown is an excellent source as well.  When I first started cooking I had a Betty Crocker cookbook that gave basic recipes for pretty much everything.  There is nothing fancy in there to be sure, but it is a handy reference guide if you are cooking something unfamiliar and just want to know the basics of how to cook it.  That's where I learned to make candy and also to add sugar to boiling corn, and not salt like I had been using.  \n\n","id":"c09uu4s","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":"1243440951","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh55","archived":true,"distinguished":null,"name":"t1_c09uu4s","author":"hailtheface","gilded":0,"parent_id":"t3_8nmw1","controversiality":0,"downs":0,"retrieved_on":1425977115,"score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_text":null,"score_hidden":false}

In essence (at least in regards to Orthodoxy) the ideal everyone should strive for would be a celibate life. It is certainly a lot more optional for heterosexuals in the Orthodox Church as straight marriage is one of the sacraments and less optional for homosexuals as gay marriage isn't permitted and one should avoid sex outside of marriage, thus no gay sex. I've got a feeling my words will have little impact overall but I hope maybe reading about Father Seraphim Rose may give you some inspiration that I and others wouldn't be able to.","name":"t1_c09uyxu","author":"outsider","archived":true,"distinguished":null}

I've read my Bible 9Xs straight through. For many years read the Watchtower &amp; Awake magazines though, everyone, looking up all the scriptures. I was extremely skeptical (I just wanted to make sure). I know they have the truth, I just got caught up worrying too much about my financial security and took a different route for a few years. Eventually I got disfellowshipped, that's where I am now. I got to know JWs very closely. I believe they are for real. \n\nAbout 2 years ago I went to the Los Angeles Holocaust Museum and sat through the experience of a Jew who meet JWs in a concentration camp. I believe, if I remember right he didn't become one of JWs until after being released. I remember how saying how he was completely amazed that they could get out at anytime they wanted, but they remained.\n\nThey didn't just sit around during Hitler's atrocities. That book I referred to called \"Betrayal, The German Churches and the Holocaust\" http://www.amazon.com/reader/0800629310?_encoding=UTF8&amp;query=jehovah#reader (Written by non-JWs) He speaks of how the typical churches kept silent, (Betraying their religion really) But then he speaks of how JWs would not keep silent.  When I used to go door to door I meet a guy from Cuba and he spoke of how his family would have hidden passages in his house and they had meetings there (Illegally). This bravery goes on around the world daily.\n\nI like listening to a talk that is from the 50s or something. It's about on of JWs names Stanley Jones who was in China, before it turned communist. He saw the writing on the wall and had ample time to take off. But, he said he didn't want to leave his new, fellow brothers. He finally got put in solitary confinement for like 11 years or so. He didn't just sit there either. He held his own meeting for himself, as if others where there. Then memorized all the scriptures from the Bible he could remember. He wrote songs he sang for himself. One of those songs he sang is my favorite, down to today.\n\nMany leaders today take quick and decisive action (George Bush for example). But, then other don't do anything. \n\nI believe JWs are doing what the Bible teaches, in turn God. One them that is very interesting that Jehovah's Witnesses teach straight from the Bible is \"Why Does God Permit Suffering?\". I found this subject fascinating and I believe the answer to this is what Gives JWs the strength to endure whatever any man will do to them.

Things that don't make rational sense are, by definition, irrational. Things that don't follow from reason are, by definition, unreasonable.\n\nAre irrationality and unreasonableness virtues? Theists have every right to believe so, and in doing so live up to every criticism of them.

The universe is a mechanical system, particles, energy, forces and whatnot. There's nothing in this system that begins to explain consciousness.\"\n\nHave you ever heard of emergent behavior?  Look into it.  It's the idea that a collection of very simple decision making agents can collectively produce behavior that is far more complex than their simple decision making ability would suggest.  An example of the idea is the organization of an ant colony.  It seems very well ordered at a high level; waste is taken to a spot as far from the living area of the colony as possible, food is moved to the appropriate places, larva are cared for, and moved when needed.  All of this suggests a high-level order.  What we have been able to discover however, is that there is NO high-level order imposed on the system.  Each individual ant makes very simple decisions based on their immediate task and environment.  All of these simple decisions made by individuals produces the emergence of a high-level order.  The same principle holds for the neurons in your brain, and your personality and consciousness emerges from this mass of simple decision making agents.\n\nI do not expect this to sway you any direction.  I find the evidence to be most compelling as an explanation for our consciousness.  It has the benefit of being understandable, a result of mechanistic processes, and the best part, it is falsifiable.  You can design an experiment in an attempt to disprove it.  The experiments have been done, and it was not disproved.  \n\nI recommend reading \"Emergence, the connected lives of ants, brains and cities\"  by Steven Johnson.  http://www.amazon.com/Emergence-Connected-Brains-Cities-Software/dp/0684868768\n\nIt's written in very clear language, and explains the concept far better than I could.\n\n\"You want another evidence that God exists? Read the four gospels.\"\n\nRead them.  Sorry, totally not compelling.  Do some more research on the historical veracity of the bible.\n\n\"There is this bizarre meme in atheistic circles that religion is just \"stupid\" and can be dismissed out of hand. It is amazingly arrogant and bigoted.\"\n\nI get REALLY irritated with believers calling atheists arrogant and bigoted.  Let's start with arrogant:  Atheists want you to prove your claim of the existence of your god.  You claim that your god is beyond proof, and that if we just had faith, we wouldn't need proof.  THAT is arrogance.  Saying things like \"Jesus said it, I believe it, that settles it!\" Is arrogant.  Simply asking for proof is not arrogant, it is skeptical.  The arrogant attitude attributed to atheists comes from seeing the amazingly bad arguments and logic used from believers, even after it has been explained to them ad nauseum why they are not even wrong.  Arrogance is taking the word of sheep herders from 2000 years ago to be more accurate than people who have spent their whole life studying the answers to very difficult questions.\n\nAs for the bigoted part...are you SURE you want to say atheists are bigoted?  After all, atheists lobbied hard to get an amendment to the California Constitution to take the right of people who love one another getting married away.  Atheists have lobbied hard for decades to take away a woman's right to choose.  An atheist president actually said \"I don't think Christians are patriots, and they should be denied citizenship.\"  Atheists are constantly trying to get the rules their god wants them to live by imposed on everyone.  \n\nOk that last one broke down.  But I think you see my point.  Christians are the ones who have done all the things I mentioned above.  Christians have a massive political organization catering to them.  Christians are the ones who are bigoted...it's built into their religion.\n\nQuit calling atheists arrogant or bigoted.  Do what Jesus said and remove the timber from your eye before you worry about the splinter in ours.

You know, a small amount of information is a very dangerous thing. The Soviet \"limitless growth\" was created by literally crushing the working class into the ground, grinding them to the bare bones and killing tens of millions in the process in order to quickly jump from a backward agrarian society to a modernish industrial society. If this is the socialism you speak of, I call you a slaver. As to the Spanish revolution, they never really made anything, and while their organization worked well enough to field a tattered army, they were just barely a match for the Spanish Loyalists, and once the USSR turned on them it all went to hell.

For instance the Liberal Democrats are to the left of New Labour...doesn't make them socialists.\n\nIt makes them more socialistic. \n\n&gt;Engels is actually a highly regarded philosopher and socialist writer. Since you want to re-define socialism and mold it in to something it is not I'm not surprised you wouldn't take anything Engels said as evidence. I suppose Marx and Marx only is the definitive Socialist source?\n\nNo, I was just being a bit hyperbolic for the fun of it.

{"body":"The article would have you think so.

I've got a [Damascus kitchen knife](http://www.amazon.com/Onion-Shun-8-Inch-Chefs-Knife/dp/B0007IR2MO) (albeit one with a ghetto-ass laser etched face on it) and the act of folding and refolding steel to make knife edges is hardly [novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katana_construction).  The *precise* way that swords were made in Damascus has been lost, but then, we couldn't build the Saturn V again precisely the way we did, either.  Which is not to say that were there significant interest, we'd get pretty close.  Something the article doesn't go into is the fact that modern blades are way the fuck stronger than 17th century Damascus blades... and that the Japanese were making better blades than the Syrians anyway.\n\n3) While fullerenes may well have contributed to the strength of Damascus steel, the majority of the strength of Damascus steel (as well as [Tamahagane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamahagane)) comes from aligned crystalline structure due to folding.  This technology has long-since been incorporated into everyday life where it makes sense; [here's a shotgun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lefever_Grade_G_Damascus_Barrels.jpg) from before factory casting became infinitely cheaper. \n\nSomething to keep in mind is that Damascus blades were super-bitchin' as far as the Crusaders were concerned because Middle Ages European tech was pretty bass-ackward.  Swords from Europe were pretty much axes evolved into weapons while swords from the far- and middle east were pretty much knives embiggened.  The Western World has made leaps and bounds technologically since then, a lot of it by incorporating the stuff the rest of the world didn't forget in the Fall of Rome.\n\nDamascus blades are badass.

How so? I didn't know that.\n\nWe've got six more chapters, since ours is based on the Septuagint version.  Jerome (in the Vulgate) put them all at the end, but modern printings will often intersperse them throughout the the book in proper chronological order per the LXX, while leaving the numbering matching Jerome's.  So Esther's chapters in [my bible](http://www.amazon.com/Ignatius-Bible-Revised-Standard-Catholic/dp/0898708338/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1243624764&amp;sr=8-2) are numbered 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 13, 4, 14, 15, 6, 7, 8, 16, 9, 10, 11.\n\nWe also have an additional Psalm and a few additional chapters of Daniel.\n\n&gt; Also, can you explain the joke up above about the council of trent?\n\nThere's a big difference between why we believe something, and when we were forced to codify it at a council.  The canon of Scripture was basically decided in the fourth century by a series of local councils (Rome, Hippo, and Carthage) while the Council of Trent was the first *ecumenical* council to codify the canon as the whole set of books Catholics hold to be canonical.  The issue was really settled for us more than 1100 years earlier, it just wasn't seriously challenged until the Protestant Reformation, in response to which the Council of Trent was convened.  So the joke is that we would base our consideration of the entire, canonized Bible on the late ecumenical council rather than on the constant practice of the Church for the millennium prior to that.\n\n&gt; And would you argue that it's been 73 books pretty much all along (since shortly after the apostles)?\n\nWell, if there weren't debate on the issue, we wouldn't have deuterocanonicals at all: they're deuterocanonical because people debated whether or not they were Scripture.  The three regional councils I mentioned before, however, not only canonized as Scripture all 27 books of the New Testament which Catholics and Protestants agree upon, but also canonized the deuterocanonicals which Protestants rejected for theological reasons.  One of the major reasons for this is simply the fact that most particular Churches had read from these books as Scripture in their Liturgy.  So from the time that Scripture was canonized, it was 73 books; between the time of the Apostles and the fourth century canonization of Scripture, traditions varied, but based on my own study, the richer tradition belongs to those who have read them than to those who rejected them.","name":"t1_c09wyfp","controversiality":0}

And that what Fox makes one sentence the NIV makes 2 gives a different meaning.\n\n","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh6c","name":"t1_c09x5jo","controversiality":0,"edited":true,"author_flair_css_class":null,"archived":true,"subreddit":"Christianity","gilded":0,"author":"matts2","downs":0,"id":"c09x5jo","created_utc":"1243641925","link_id":"t3_8o2r3","score_hidden":false,"parent_id":"t1_c09wxib","author_flair_text":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"retrieved_on":1425978259,"distinguished":null}

I picked it up for the first time in thirty years only to realize that Throreau's philosophy had long ago permeated my being. I remember being blown away by my first reading more than half a century ago, but with each immersion new depths are achieved.\n\nThoreau sought both authenticity and simplicity in his life. He never abandoned Concord and the real world but merely sought refuge at Walden to plumb the depths of his being. Serious introspection and brilliant writing show each of us the the way to our own core. Can we stand the examination? That is for each of us to determine.\n\nThe Transcendentalists may never have been able to define their philosphy, but what remains of it more than a century after the movement's passing can be summed up in Thoreau's always upbeat outlook of \"...if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet success unexpected in common hours.\"\n\nOne cannot read Walden without gaining confidence in one's ability to change direction in life and optimism about the future. We do not have to live lives of conformity and quiet desparation. \"In the long run men hit only what they aim at. Therefore, though they should fail immediately, they had better aim at something high.\"\n\nThere has never been a book that better expresses American optimism, and there is no reason for us to lose confidence now. Simplify and be as close to authentic as you can be and all will turn out well.

I have two boys, just turned 7 and 9. \n\nI would say the key thing is to pursue a two-track book selection strategy. One track is early-reader books (one sentence + picture, each page) that he'll be tempted to sound out words on. Our younger son loved [Fly Guy](http://www.amazon.com/Super-Fly-Guy-Tedd-Arnold/dp/0439639042) -- that's a whole series.  \n\nAlso, anything by [Jan Brett](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b_1_7?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=jan+brett+books&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;sprefix=Jan+Bre) is beautifully illustrated on each page, and great read-along books. We also had a read-along series of [spongebob books](http://www.amazon.com/Spongebob-Squarepants-Phonics-Sonia-Sander/dp/0439779480/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1243692272&amp;sr=1-1) that were based on phonics (each book emphasized a particular letter sound). Great for reading-to, and you can point to the words to start him on.\n\nThe other track is chapter books or that sort of level that you can read to him, and eventually he will start looking over your shoulder -- the best series we've found here are the [Magic Tree House](http://www.amazon.com/Magic-Tree-House-Boxed-Books/dp/0375813659/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1) books (there are dozens in the series) -- which might be good for read-to in a year or so, and in 1st grade he'll try reading himself.\n\nBut the most important advice I could give you is to **go to your public library and talk to the children's librarian**. They're not there just to shelve books or shush kids! Believe it or not, they have an encyclopedic knowledge of children's books at all levels, different reading strategies, etc. (not to mention in-library children's programs). They love nothing more than recommending books, and if you become a habitual library visitor with your child, they'll develop the habit on their own. If there was one mistake I made with my older son in this area, it was thinking, \"I'm an involved parent, I don't need help!\". Your guy isn't too young to benefit from the librarian, and getting him his own library card as a 4th-birthday present would probably make him feel like a \"big kid\" -- and we know how important that is!\n\nGood luck, let me know how it goes!

I grew up with dogs, so while I was used to having pets I was *not* prepared to owning and managing a feline.\n\nGeneral tips, in no particular order:\n\n1) Cats normally don't do \"misbehave\" unless they are bored. Get a bunch of toys, particularly ones that he can play with alone (toys filled with catnip are always good). If he has claws, you can get rubber tips instead of de-clawing, or just trim them every few weeks so he can't do any damage even if he tried.\n\n2) Give him space, but also be prepared to follow his schedule. Some cats are affecionate on demand, and some just when they feel like it. Mine is the latter, so our preferences don't always overlap: sometimes he wants petting and I'm working, or he doesn't care but I'm watching TV and want to cuddle. I've noticed that if I compromise, even if it's just to take a break and give some scratches for 5 minutes while I'm working, he tends to behave more civilly than if I try to force it or whatnot.\n\n3) Cats *love* windows, or anywhere else they can see outside and/or bask in the sunlight. Get one of those window-mounted cat shelves for him to lay on, or place a bed/pillow on furniture or something else sturdy that'll give him a view of the outdoors.\n\n4) It may sound obvious, but clean the litter box daily! We have two cats, and it doesn't take very much extra crap (pun intended) in the box for them to get moody and do their business on the carpet. Most pet stores have huge tubs of scoobable litter that is just as good as the name-brand stuff, and if it's clumbable then you just need to scoop it quickly instead of constantly changing the entire batch.\n\n5) While we're on the topic of litter boxes: get one that has a cover, or even better a [booda dome](http://www.amazon.com/Booda-Dome-Litter-Box-Titanium/dp/B0002DH8JG). Cats like a little privacy while pooping, and the booda dome type of litter boxes will help keep the litter in the box instead of all over your floors.","distinguished":null,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"downs":0}
